-- When cabal tries to install a number of packages, including all their
-- dependencies it has a non-trivial problem to solve.
--
-- The Problem:
--
-- In general we start with a set of installed packages and a set of available
-- packages.
--
-- Installed packages have fixed dependencies. They have already been built and
-- we know exactly what packages they were built against, including their exact
-- versions. 
--
-- Available package have somewhat flexible dependencies. They are specified as
-- version ranges, though really they're predicates. To make matters worse they
-- have conditional flexible dependencies. Configuration flags can affect which
-- packages are required and can place additional constraints on their
-- versions.
--
-- These two sets of package can and usually do overlap. There can be installed
-- packages that are also available which means they could be re-installed if
-- required, though there will also be packages which are not available and
-- cannot be re-installed. Very often there will be extra versions available
-- than are installed. Sometimes we may like to prefer installed packages over
-- available ones or perhaps always prefer the latest available version whether
-- installed or not.
--
-- The goal is to calculate an installation plan that is acyclic, consistent
-- and complete.
--
-- An installation plan is a set of packages that are going to be used
-- together. It will consist of a mixture of installed packages and available
-- packages along with their exact version dependencies. An installation plan
-- is complete if for every package in the set, all of its dependencies are
-- also in the set. It is consistent if for every package in the set, all
-- dependencies which target that package have the same version.

-- | A 'ConfiguredPackage' is a not-yet-installed package along with the
-- total configuration information. The configuration information is total in
-- the sense that it provides all the configuration information and so the
-- final configure process will be independent of the environment.
