-- | Like db3, but the flag picks a different package rather than a

--
-- In db3 we cannot install C and D as independent goals because:
--
-- * The multiple instance restriction says C and D _must_ share B
-- * Since C relies on A-1, C needs B to be compiled with flagB on
-- * Since D relies on A-2, D needs B to be compiled with flagB off
-- * Hence C and D have incompatible requirements on B's flags.
--
-- However, _even_ if we don't check explicitly that we pick the same flag
-- assignment for 0.B and 1.B, we will still detect the problem because
-- 0.B depends on 0.A-1, 1.B depends on 1.A-2, hence we cannot link 0.A to
-- 1.A and therefore we cannot link 0.B to 1.B.
--
-- In db4 the situation however is trickier. We again cannot install
-- packages C and D as independent goals because:
--
-- * As above, the multiple instance restriction says that C and D _must_ share B
-- * Since C relies on Ax-2, it requires B to be compiled with flagB off
-- * Since D relies on Ay-2, it requires B to be compiled with flagB on
-- * Hence C and D have incompatible requirements on B's flags.
--
-- But now this requirement is more indirect. If we only check dependencies
-- we don't see the problem:
--
-- * We link 0.B to 1.B
-- * 0.B relies on Ay-1
-- * 1.B relies on Ax-1
--
-- We will insist that 0.Ay will be linked to 1.Ay, and 0.Ax to 1.Ax, but since
-- we only ever assign to one of these, these constraints are never broken.

-- * E depends on A-1 directly and on A through its test suite. We prefer

-- * B: Simple example, just make sure setup deps are taken into account at all

--      In this case we prefer to link
-- * D: Variation on C.1 where the package requires a specific (not latest)

--      link (picking the older version)
-- * E: Variation on C.2 with the setup dependency the more inflexible.
--      Currently, in this case we do not see the opportunity to link because
--      we consider setup dependencies after normal dependencies; we will
--      pick A.2 for E, then realize we cannot link E.setup.A to A.2, and pick
--      A.1 instead. This isn't so easy to fix (if we want to fix it at all);

--      not an improvement, because in general we would prefer to link setup
--      setups to package deps, rather than the other way around. (For example,
--      if we change this ordering then the test for D would start to install
--      two versions of A).
-- * F: The package and the setup script depend on different versions of A.
--      This will only work if setup dependencies are considered independent.

-- | Cycles through test cycles that can be broken if test suites dependencies
-- are independent from dependencies of the library proper
--
-- This models situations such as the following:
--
-- * optparse-applicative (A) has a test suite that depends on tasty (T)
-- * tasty (T) has a (regular) dependency on optparse-applicative
--
-- We can resolve this by linking optparse-applicative's test suite against an
-- older version of itself.
--
-- Test suites can be written in two different ways:
--
-- * The test suite declares an explicit, internal, dependency on the library
-- * The test suite compiles the library in directly (by adding the @/src@
--   to the test suite's list of source directories, or whatever)
--
-- Whichever option is chosen, it is of course very important that the test
-- suite gets compiled against /this/ version of the library. It would be
-- terribly confusing if tests started failing because the test suite got built
-- against an old version of the library from Hackage, rather than the version
-- in the current directory. This happens by default if option (B) is chosen,
-- but in the case of option (A) we need to make sure that the solver picks the
-- right version (that is, /this/ version) for the internal dependency.
--
-- In the case of optparse-applicative's test suite, the tests should be
-- linked against /this/ version of optparse-applicative; however, it is not
-- essential that its transitive dependency on itself through tasty is also
-- linked against the same version. Indeed, the only way to break the cycle is
-- to link tasty against a /different/ version (typically an older, perhaps
-- already installed, version).
--
-- This means that (again whichever method we chose) we will end up with two
-- versions of the library in a single executable (the test suite): in the
-- example, we will have both the version of optparse-applicative that we are
-- testing as well as the older version that we linked tasty against. This does
-- have the unfortunate consequence that if tasty does not re-export all
-- functionality from optparse-applicative, it might mean that
-- optparse-applicative cannot use tasty's full functionality because it cannot
-- construct elements of types defined in the older version of
-- optparse-applicative (as it can only import the newer version). What this
-- means in practice is that if this feature becomes more popular, packages like
-- tasty will have become more careful with their "private" dependencies,
-- re-exporting the bits of optparse-applicative that it requires for its API.
--
-- Normally when we compile a library, we conservatively assume that all its
-- transitive dependencies should be able to be used together. For test suites
-- however we optimistically assume that any of the transitive dependencies
-- of the "private" test suite dependencies are not used by the library and
-- can therefore be different versions.
--
-- In this database we test both scenarios: A, T, B models the scenario where
-- the test suite compiles in the library directly; A', T', B' models the
-- scenario where the test suite declares the internal lib dependency.
-- (B/B' is just there to force the version of A.) We expect the same
-- solution in either case.
