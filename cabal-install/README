    CabalInstall, what happens under the hood.

  FetchCmd:
    cabal-install stores packages in [config-dir]/packages/ by their package id.
    This can lead to clashes if there's two identical (same name, same version)
    packages from two servers with different functionality.
  CleanCmd:
    Removes all fetched packages.
  UpdateCmd:
    Queries all known servers for their packages and stores it in [cfg-dir]/pkg.list.
  InstallCmd:
    Installed packages are determined, and dependencies of the to-be-installed packages
    are resolved and fetched.
    The fetched tarballs are moved to a temporary directory (usually /tmp) and extracted.
    Distribution.Simple.SetupWrapper is used to configure, build and install the
    unpacked package. The user can
    only pass arguments to the 'configure' phase of the installation. '--user' is used
    by default.
  InfoCmd:
    To be written.


  Files used by cabal-install:
    [cfg-dir]/config        configuration file
    [cfg-dir]/00-index.tar         list of packages available from the servers.
    [cfg-dir]/packages/        directory containing all fetched packages.
