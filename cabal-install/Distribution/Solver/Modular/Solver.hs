-- | Run all solver phases.

-- In principle, we have a valid tree after 'validationPhase', which
-- means that every 'Done' node should correspond to valid solution.
--
-- There is one exception, though, and that is cycle detection, which
-- has been added relatively recently. Cycles are only removed directly
-- before exploration.
--
-- Semantically, there is no difference. Cycle detection, as implemented
-- now, only occurs for 'Done' nodes we encounter during exploration,
-- and cycle detection itself does not change the shape of the tree,
-- it only marks some 'Done' nodes as 'Fail', if they contain cyclic
-- solutions.
--
-- There is a tiny performance impact, however, in doing cycle detection
-- directly after validation. Probably because cycle detection maintains
-- some information, and the various reorderings implemented by
-- 'preferencesPhase' and 'heuristicsPhase' are ever so slightly more
-- costly if that information is already around during the reorderings.
--
-- With the current positioning directly before the 'explorePhase', there
-- seems to be no statistically significant performance impact of cycle
-- detection in the common case where there are no cycles.

    -- Counting conflicts and reordering goals interferes, as both are strategies to
    -- change the order of goals.
    --
    -- We therefore change the strategy based on whether --count-conflicts is set or
    -- not:
    --
    -- - when --count-conflicts is set, we use preferReallyEasyGoalChoices, which
    --   prefers (keeps) goals only if the have 0 or 1 enabled choice.
    --
    -- - when --count-conflicts is not set, we use preferEasyGoalChoices, which
    --   (next to preferring goals with 0 or 1 enabled choice)
    --   also prefers goals that have 2 enabled choices over goals with more than
    --   two enabled choices.
    --
    -- In the past, we furthermore used P.firstGoal to trim down the goal choice nodes
    -- to just a single option. This was a way to work around a space leak that was
    -- unnecessary and is now fixed, so we no longer do it.
    --
    -- If --count-conflicts is active, it will then choose among the remaining goals
    -- the one that has been responsible for the most conflicts so far.
    --
    -- Otherwise, we simply choose the first remaining goal.
