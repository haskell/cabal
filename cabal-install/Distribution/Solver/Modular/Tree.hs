    --
    -- The first Bool indicates whether it's weak/trivial,
    -- the second Bool whether it's manual.
    --
    -- A choice is called trivial if it clearly does not matter. The
    -- special case of triviality we actually consider is if there are no new
    -- dependencies introduced by this node.
    --
    -- A (flag) choice is called weak if we do want to defer it. This is the
    -- case for flags that should be implied by what's currently installed on
    -- the system, as opposed to flags that are used to explicitly enable or
    -- disable some functionality.
  | FChoice QFN a Bool Bool (PSQ Bool (Tree a))

    -- | Choose whether or not to enable a stanza
    --
    -- The Bool indicates whether it's trivial (see 'FChoice' for a discussion
    -- of triviality).
  | SChoice QSN a Bool (PSQ Bool (Tree a))

    -- | Choose which choice to make next
    --
    -- Invariants:
    --
    -- * PSQ should never be empty
    -- * For each choice we additionally record the 'QGoalReason' why we are
    --   introducing that goal into tree. Note that most of the time we are
    --   working with @Tree QGoalReason@; in that case, we must have the
    --   invariant that the 'QGoalReason' cached in the 'PChoice', 'FChoice'
    --   or 'SChoice' directly below a 'GoalChoice' node must equal the reason
    --   recorded on that 'GoalChoice' node.

-- | A package option is a package instance with an optional linking annotation
--
-- The modular solver has a number of package goals to solve for, and can only
-- pick a single package version for a single goal. In order to allow to
-- install multiple versions of the same package as part of a single solution
-- the solver uses qualified goals. For example, @0.P@ and @1.P@ might both
-- be qualified goals for @P@, allowing to pick a difference version of package
-- @P@ for @0.P@ and @1.P@.
--
-- Linking is an essential part of this story. In addition to picking a specific
-- version for @1.P@, the solver can also decide to link @1.P@ to @0.P@ (or
-- vice versa). It means that @1.P@ and @0.P@ really must be the very same package
-- (and hence must have the same build time configuration, and their
-- dependencies must also be the exact same).

-- See <http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/03/qualified-goals/> for details.
