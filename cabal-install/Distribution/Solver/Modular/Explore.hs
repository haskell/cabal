-- | This function takes the variable we're currently considering, a
-- last conflict set and a list of children's logs. Each log yields
-- either a solution or a conflict set. The result is a combined log for
-- the parent node that has explored a prefix of the children.
--
-- We can stop traversing the children's logs if we find an individual
-- conflict set that does not contain the current variable. In this
-- case, we can just lift the conflict set to the current level,
-- because the current level cannot possibly have contributed to this
-- conflict, so no other choice at the current level would avoid the
-- conflict.
--
-- If any of the children might contain a successful solution, we can
-- return it immediately. If all children contain conflict sets, we can
-- take the union as the combined conflict set.
--
-- The last conflict set corresponds to the justification that we
-- have to choose this goal at all. There is a reason why we have
-- introduced the goal in the first place, and this reason is in conflict
-- with the (virtual) option not to choose anything for the current
-- variable. See also the comments for 'avoidSet'.

-- | Build a conflict set corresponding to the (virtual) option not to
-- choose a solution for a goal at all.
--
-- In the solver, the set of goals is not statically determined, but depends
-- on the choices we make. Therefore, when dealing with conflict sets, we
-- always have to consider that we could perhaps make choices that would
-- avoid the existence of the goal completely.
--
-- Whenever we actually introduce a choice in the tree, we have already established
-- that the goal cannot be avoided. This is tracked in the "goal reason".
-- The choice to avoid the goal therefore is a conflict between the goal itself
-- and its goal reason. We build this set here, and pass it to the 'backjump'
-- function as the last conflict set.
--
-- This has two effects:
--
-- - In a situation where there are no choices available at all (this happens
-- if an unknown package is requested), the last conflict set becomes the
-- actual conflict set.
--
-- - In a situation where all of the children's conflict sets contain the
-- current variable, the goal reason of the current node will be added to the
-- conflict set.
