-- have to convert the package indices to the uniform index used
-- by the solver; we also have to convert the initial constraints;

-- plan.

-- | Run 'D.S.Modular.Solver.solve' and then produce a summarized log to display
-- in the error case.
--
-- When there is no solution, we produce the error message by rerunning the
-- solver but making it prefer the goals from the final conflict set from the
-- first run. We also set the backjump limit to 0, so that the log stops at the
-- first backjump and is relatively short. Preferring goals from the final
-- conflict set increases the probability that the log to the first backjump
-- contains package, flag, and stanza choices that are relevant to the final
-- failure. The solver shouldn't need to choose any packages that aren't in the
-- final conflict set. (For every variable in the final conflict set, the final
-- conflict set should also contain the variable that introduced that variable.
-- The solver can then follow that chain of variables in reverse order from the
-- user target to the conflict.) However, it is possible that the conflict set
-- contains unnecessary variables.
--
-- Producing an error message when the solver reaches the backjump limit is more
-- complicated. There is no final conflict set, so we create one for the minimal
-- subtree containing the path that the solver took to the first backjump. This
-- conflict set helps explain why the solver reached the backjump limit, because
-- the first backjump contributes to reaching the backjump limit. Additionally,
-- the solver is much more likely to be able to finish traversing this subtree
-- before the backjump limit, since its size is linear (not exponential) in the
-- number of goal choices. We create it by pruning all children after the first
-- successful child under each node in the original tree, so that there is at
-- most one valid choice at each level. Then we use the final conflict set from
-- that run to generate an error message, as in the case where the solver found
-- that there was no solution.
--
-- Using the full log from a rerun of the solver ensures that the log is
-- complete, i.e., it shows the whole chain of dependencies from the user
-- targets to the conflicting packages.
