-- Setup.hs script policy

--
--  1. @build-type@ Custom with a @custom-setup@ section
--  2. @build-type@ Custom without a @custom-setup@ section
--  3. @build-type@ not Custom with @cabal-version >  $our-cabal-version@
--  4. @build-type@ not Custom with @cabal-version <= $our-cabal-version@
--
-- It's also worth noting that packages specifying @cabal-version: >= 1.23@
-- or later that have @build-type@ Custom will always have a @custom-setup@
-- section. Therefore in case 2, the specified @cabal-version@ will always be
-- less than 1.23.
--
-- In cases 1 and 2 we obviously have to build an external Setup.hs script,
-- while in case 4 we can use the internal library API. In case 3 we also have
-- to build an external Setup.hs script because the package needs a later
-- Cabal lib version than we can support internally.
