-- When cabal tries to install a number of packages, including all their
-- dependencies it has a non-trivial problem to solve.
--
-- The Problem:
--
-- In general we start with a set of installed packages and a set of source
-- packages.
--
-- Installed packages have fixed dependencies. They have already been built and
-- we know exactly what packages they were built against, including their exact
-- versions.
--
-- Source package have somewhat flexible dependencies. They are specified as
-- version ranges, though really they're predicates. To make matters worse they
-- have conditional flexible dependencies. Configuration flags can affect which
-- packages are required and can place additional constraints on their
-- versions.
--
-- These two sets of package can and usually do overlap. There can be installed
-- packages that are also available as source packages which means they could
-- be re-installed if required, though there will also be packages which are
-- not available as source and cannot be re-installed. Very often there will be
-- extra versions available than are installed. Sometimes we may like to prefer
-- installed packages over source ones or perhaps always prefer the latest
-- available version whether installed or not.
--
-- The goal is to calculate an installation plan that is closed, acyclic and
-- consistent and where every configured package is valid.
--
-- An installation plan is a set of packages that are going to be used
-- together. It will consist of a mixture of installed packages and source
-- packages along with their exact version dependencies. An installation plan
-- is closed if for every package in the set, all of its dependencies are
-- also in the set. It is consistent if for every package in the set, all
-- dependencies which target that package have the same version.

-- Note that plans do not necessarily compose. You might have a valid plan for
-- package A and a valid plan for package B. That does not mean the composition
-- is simultaneously valid for A and B. In particular you're most likely to
-- have problems with inconsistent dependencies.
-- On the other hand it is true that every closed sub plan is valid.

-- | Packages in an install plan
--
-- NOTE: 'ConfiguredPackage', 'GenericReadyPackage' and 'GenericPlanPackage'
-- intentionally have no 'PackageInstalled' instance. `This is important:
-- PackageInstalled returns only library dependencies, but for package that
-- aren't yet installed we know many more kinds of dependencies (setup
-- dependencies, exe, test-suite, benchmark, ..). Any functions that operate on
-- dependencies in cabal-install should consider what to do with these
-- dependencies; if we give a 'PackageInstalled' instance it would be too easy
-- to get this wrong (and, for instance, call graph traversal functions from
-- Cabal rather than from cabal-install). Instead, see 'PackageInstalled'.

-- Alert alert!   Why does SolverId map to a LIST of plan packages?

-- some people rely on the build-depends to ALSO implicitly
-- depend on an executable.
--
-- I don't want to commit to a strategy yet, so the only possible
-- thing you can do in this case is return EVERYTHING and let
-- the client filter out what they want (executables? libraries?
-- etc).  This similarly implies we can't return a 'ConfiguredId'
-- because that's not enough information.

-- * Primitives for traversing plans
-- ------------------------------------------------------------

-- $traversal
--
-- Algorithms to traverse or execute an 'InstallPlan', especially in parallel,
-- may make use of the 'Processing' type and the associated operations
-- 'ready', 'completed' and 'failed'.
--
-- The 'Processing' type is used to keep track of the state of a traversal and
-- includes the set of packages that are in the processing state, e.g. in the
-- process of being installed, plus those that have been completed and those
-- where processing failed.
--
-- Traversal algorithms start with an 'InstallPlan':
--
-- * Initially there will be certain packages that can be processed immediately
--   (since they are configured source packages and have all their dependencies
--   installed already). The function 'ready' returns these packages plus a
--   'Processing' state that marks these same packages as being in the
--   processing state.
--
-- * The algorithm must now arrange for these packages to be processed
--   (possibly in parallel). When a package has completed processing, the
--   algorithm needs to know which other packages (if any) are now ready to
--   process as a result. The 'completed' function marks a package as completed
--   and returns any packages that are newly in the processing state (ie ready
--   to process), along with the updated 'Processing' state.
--
-- * If failure is possible then when processing a package fails, the algorithm
--   needs to know which other packages have also failed as a result. The
--   'failed' function marks the given package as failed as well as all the
--   other packages that depend on the failed package. In addition it returns
--   the other failed packages.


-- | The 'Processing' type is used to keep track of the state of a traversal
-- and includes the set of packages that are in the processing state, e.g. in
-- the process of being installed, plus those that have been completed and
-- those where processing failed.

-- | The packages in the plan that are initially ready to be installed.
-- That is they are in the configured state and have all their dependencies
-- installed already.
--
-- The result is both the packages that are now ready to be installed and also
-- a 'Processing' state containing those same packages. The assumption is that
-- all the packages that are ready will now be processed and so we can consider
-- them to be in the processing state.

-- can be used for simultations or presenting execution dry-runs.
--
-- It is guaranteed to give the same order as using 'execute' (with a serial
-- in-order 'JobControl'), which is a reverse topological orderings of the
-- source packages in the dependency graph, albeit not necessarily exactly the
-- same ordering as that produced by 'reverseTopologicalOrder'.

-- | Execute an install plan. This traverses the plan in dependency order.
--
-- Executing each individual package can fail and if so all dependents fail
-- too. The result for each package is collected as a 'BuildOutcomes' map.
--
-- Visiting each package happens with optional parallelism, as determined by
-- the 'JobControl'. By default, after any failure we stop as soon as possible
-- (using the 'JobControl' to try to cancel in-progress tasks). This behaviour
-- can be reversed to keep going and build as many packages as possible.
