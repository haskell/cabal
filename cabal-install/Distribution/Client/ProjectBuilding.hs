------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Overall building strategy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- We start with an 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' that has already been improved by
-- reusing packages from the store. So the remaining packages in the
-- 'InstallPlan.Configured' state are ones we either need to build or rebuild.
--
-- First, we do a preliminary dry run phase where we work out which packages
-- we really need to (re)build, and for the ones we do need to build which
-- build phase to start at.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Dry run: what bits of the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' will we execute?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We split things like this for a couple reasons. Firstly we need to be able
-- to do dry runs, and these need to be reasonably accurate in terms of
-- letting users know what (and why) things are going to be (re)built.
--
-- Given that we need to be able to do dry runs, it would not be great if
-- we had to repeat all the same work when we do it for real. Not only is
-- it duplicate work, but it's duplicate code which is likely to get out of
-- sync. So we do things only once. We preserve info we discover in the dry
-- run phase and rely on it later when we build things for real. This also
-- somewhat simplifies the build phase. So this way the dry run can't so
-- easily drift out of sync with the real thing since we're relying on the
-- info it produces.
--
-- An additional advantage is that it makes it easier to debug rebuild
-- errors (ie rebuilding too much or too little), since all the rebuild
-- decisions are made without making any state changes at the same time
-- (that would make it harder to reproduce the problem sitation).


-- | The 'BuildStatus' of every package in the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan'.
--
-- This is used as the result of the dry-run of building an install plan.
--
type BuildStatusMap = Map UnitId BuildStatus

-- | The build status for an individual package is the state that the
-- package is in /prior/ to initiating a (re)build.
--
-- This should not be confused with a 'BuildResult' which is the result
-- /after/ successfully building a package.
--
-- It serves two purposes:
--
--  * For dry-run output, it lets us explain to the user if and why a package
--    is going to be (re)built.
--
--  * It tell us what step to start or resume building from, and carries
--    enough information for us to be able to do so.
