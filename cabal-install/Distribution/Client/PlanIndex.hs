-- Note [FakeMap]
-----------------
-- We'd like to use the PackageIndex defined in this module for
-- cabal-install's InstallPlan.  However, at the moment, this
-- data structure is indexed by InstalledPackageId, which we don't
-- know until after we've compiled a package (whereas InstallPlan
-- needs to store not-compiled packages in the index.) Eventually,
-- an InstalledPackageId will be calculatable prior to actually
-- building the package (making it something of a misnomer), but
-- at the moment, the "fake installed package ID map" is a workaround
-- to solve this problem while reusing PackageIndex.  The basic idea
-- is that, since we don't know what an InstalledPackageId is
-- beforehand, we just fake up one based on the package ID (it only
-- needs to be unique for the particular install plan), and fill
-- it out with the actual generated InstalledPackageId after the
-- package is successfully compiled.
--
-- However, there is a problem: in the index there may be
-- references using the old package ID, which are now dangling if
-- we update the InstalledPackageId.  We could map over the entire
-- index to update these pointers as well (a costly operation), but
-- instead, we've chosen to parametrize a variety of important functions
-- by a FakeMap, which records what a fake installed package ID was
-- actually resolved to post-compilation.  If we do a lookup, we first
-- check and see if it's a fake ID in the FakeMap.
--
-- It's a bit grungy, but we expect this to only be temporary anyway.
-- (Another possible workaround would have been to *not* update
-- the installed package ID, but I decided this would be hard to
-- understand.)
