-- | The 'combine' function is at the heart of backjumping. It takes
-- the variable we're currently considering, and a list of children
-- annotated with their respective conflict sets, and an accumulator
-- for the result conflict set. It returns a combined conflict set
-- for the parent node, and a (potentially shortened) list of children
-- with the annotations removed.
--
-- It is *essential* that we produce the results as early as possible.
-- In particular, we have to produce the list of children prior to
-- traversing the entire list -- otherwise we lose the desired behaviour
-- of being able to traverse the tree from left to right incrementally.
--
-- We can shorten the list of children if we find an individual conflict
-- set that does not contain the current variable. In this case, we can
-- just lift the conflict set to the current level, because the current
-- level cannot possibly have contributed to this conflict, so no other
-- choice at the current level would avoid the conflict.
--
-- If any of the children might contain a successful solution
-- (indicated by Nothing), then Nothing will be the combined
-- conflict set. If all children contain conflict sets, we can
-- take the union as the combined conflict set.
