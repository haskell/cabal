-- In practice, most constraints are implication constraints (IF we have made
-- a number of choices, THEN we also have to ensure that). We call constraints
-- that for which the precondiditions are fulfilled ACTIVE. We maintain a set
-- of currently active constraints that we pass down the node.
--
-- We aim at detecting inconsistent states as early as possible.
--
-- Whenever we make a choice, there are two things that need to happen:
--
--   (1) We must check that the choice is consistent with the currently
--       active constraints.
--
--   (2) The choice increases the set of active constraints. For the new
--       active constraints, we must check that they are consistent with
--       the current state.
--
-- We can actually merge (1) and (2) by saying the the current choice is
-- a new active constraint, fixing the choice.
--
-- If a test fails, we have detected an inconsistent state. We can
-- disable the current subtree and do not have to traverse it any further.
--
-- We need a good way to represent the current state, i.e., the current
-- set of active constraints. Since the main situation where we have to
-- search in it is (1), it seems best to store the state by package: for
-- every package, we store which versions are still allowed. If for any
-- package, we have inconsistent active constraints, we can also stop.
-- This is a particular way to read task (2):
--
--   (2, weak) We only check if the new constraints are consistent with
--       the choices we've already made, and add them to the active set.
--
--   (2, strong) We check if the new constraints are consistent with the
--       choices we've already made, and the constraints we already have.
--
-- It currently seems as if we're implementing the weak variant. However,
-- when used together with 'preferEasyGoalChoices', we will find an
-- inconsistent state in the very next step.
--
-- What do we do about flags?
--
-- Like for packages, we store the flag choices we have already made.
-- Now, regarding (1), we only have to test whether we've decided the
-- current flag before. Regarding (2), the interesting bit is in discovering
-- the new active constraints. To this end, we look up the constraints for
-- the package the flag belongs to, and traverse its flagged dependencies.
-- Wherever we find the flag in question, we start recording dependencies
-- underneath as new active dependencies. If we encounter other flags, we
-- check if we've chosen them already and either proceed or stop.
