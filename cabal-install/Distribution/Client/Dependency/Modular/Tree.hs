  -- Above, a choice is called trivial if it clearly does not matter. The
  -- special case of triviality we actually consider is if there are no new
  -- dependencies introduced by this node.
  --
  -- A (flag) choice is called weak if we do want to defer it. This is the
  -- case for flags that should be implied by what's currently installed on
  -- the system, as opposed to flags that are used to explicitly enable or
  -- disable some functionality.

-- | A package option is a package instance with an optional linking annotation
--
-- The modular solver has a number of package goals to solve for, and can only
-- pick a single package version for a single goal. In order to allow to
-- install multiple versions of the same package as part of a single solution
-- the solver uses qualified goals. For example, @0.P@ and @1.P@ might both
-- be qualified goals for @P@, allowing to pick a difference version of package
-- @P@ for @0.P@ and @1.P@.
--
-- Linking is an essential part of this story. In addition to picking a specific
-- version for @1.P@, the solver can also decide to link @1.P@ to @0.P@ (or
-- vice versa). Teans that @1.P@ and @0.P@ really must be the very same package
-- (and hence must have the same build time configuration, and their
-- dependencies must also be the exact same).
--
-- See <http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/03/qualified-goals/> for details.
