-- | This module deals with building and incrementally rebuilding a collection
-- of packages. It is what backs the @cabal build@ and @configure@ commands,
-- as well as being a core part of @run@, @test@, @bench@ and others. 
--
-- The primary thing is in fact rebuilding (and trying to make that quick by
-- not redoing unnecessary work), so building from scratch is just a special
-- case.
--
-- The build process and the code can be understood by breaking it down into
-- three major parts:
--
-- * The 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' type
--
-- * The \"what to do\" phase, where we look at the all input configuration
--   (project files, .cabal files, command line etc) and produce a detailed
--   plan of what to do -- the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan'.
--
-- * The \"do it\" phase, where we take the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' and we
-- re-execute it.
--
-- As far as possible, the \"what to do\" phase embodies all the policy, leaving
-- the \"do it\" phase policy free. The first phase contains more of the
-- complicated logic, but it is contained in code that is either pure or just
-- has read effects (except cache updates). Then the second phase does all the
-- actions to build packages, but as far as possible it just follows the
-- instructions and avoids any logic for deciding what to do (apart from
-- recompilation avoidance in executing the plan).
--
-- This division helps us keep the code under control, making it easier to
-- understand, test and debug. So when you are extending these modules, please
-- think about which parts of your change belong in which part. It is
-- perfectly ok to extend the description of what to do (i.e. the 
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan') if that helps keep the policy decisions in the
-- first phase. Also, the second phase does not have direct access to any of
-- the input configuration anyway; all the information has to flow via the
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan'.

-- Taking targets into account, selecting what to build
--

-- | Adjust an 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' by selecting just those parts of it
-- required to build the given user targets.
--
-- How to get the 'PackageTarget's from the 'UserBuildTarget' is customisable,
-- so that we can change the meaning of @pkgname@ to target a build or
-- repl depending on which command is calling it.
--
-- Conceptually, every target identifies one or more roots in the
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan', which we then use to determine the closure
-- of what packages need to be built, dropping everything from
-- 'ElaboratedInstallPlan' that is unnecessary.
--
-- There is a complication, however: In an ideal world, every
-- possible target would be a node in the graph.  However, it is
-- currently not possible (and possibly not even desirable) to invoke a
-- Setup script to build *just* one file.  Similarly, it is not possible
-- to invoke a pre Cabal-1.25 custom Setup script and build only one
-- component.  In these cases, we want to build the entire package, BUT
-- only actually building some of the files/components.  This is what
-- 'pkgBuildTargets', 'pkgReplTarget' and 'pkgBuildHaddock' control.
-- Arguably, these should an out-of-band mechanism rather than stored
-- in 'ElaboratedInstallPlan', but it's what we have.  We have
-- to fiddle around with the ElaboratedConfiguredPackage roots to say
-- what it will build.
