1.25.x.x (current development version)
	* Removed the '--root-cmd' parameter of the 'install' command
	(#3356).
	* Deprecated 'cabal install --global' (#3356).
	* Changed 'cabal upload' to upload a package candidate by default
	(#3419). Same applies to uploading documentation.
	* Added a new 'cabal upload' flag '--publish' for publishing a
	package on Hackage instead of uploading a candidate (#3419).
	* Added optional solver output visualisation support via the
	tracetree package. Mainly intended for debugging (#3410).
	* Removed the '--check' option from 'cabal upload'
	(#1823). It was replaced by package candidates.
	* Fixed various behaviour differences between network transports
	(#3429).
	* The bootstrap script now works correctly when run from a Git
	clone (#3439).
	* Removed the top-down solver (#3598).
	* The '-v/--verbosity' option no longer affects GHC verbosity
	(except in the case of '-v0'). Use '--ghc-options=-v' to enable
	verbose GHC output (#3540, #3671).
	* Added a warning when the external setup method uses a Cabal library
	older than that used to build cabal-install (#707).

1.24.0.0 Ryan Thomas <ryan@ryant.org> March 2016
	* If there are multiple remote repos, 'cabal update' now updates
	them in parallel (#2503).
	* New 'cabal upload' option '-P'/'--password-command' for reading
	Hackage password from arbitrary program output (#2506).
	* Better warning for 'cabal run' (#2510).
	* 'cabal init' now warns if the chosen package name is already
	registered in the source package index (#2436).
	* New 'cabal install' option: '--offline' (#2578).
	* Accept 'builddir' field in cabal.config (#2484)
	* Read 'builddir' option from 'CABAL_BUILDDIR' environment variable.
	* Remote repos may now be configured to use https URLs. This uses
	either curl or wget or, on Windows, PowerShell, under the hood (#2687).
	* Install target URLs can now use https e.g. 'cabal install
	https://example.com/foo-1.0.tar.gz'.
	* Automatically use https for cabal upload for the main
	hackage.haskell.org (other repos will use whatever they are
	configured to use).
	* Support for dependencies of custom Setup.hs scripts
	(see http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/cabal-setup-deps/).
	* 'cabal' program itself now can be used as an external setup
	method. This fixes an issue when Cabal version mismatch caused
	unnecessary reconfigures (#2633).
	* Improved error message for unsatisfiable package constraints
	(#2727).
	* Fixed a space leak in 'cabal update' (#2826).
	* 'cabal exec' and 'sandbox hc-pkg' now use the configured
	compiler (#2859).
	* New 'cabal haddock' option: '--for-hackage' (#2852).
	* Added a warning when the solver cannot find a dependency (#2853).
	* New 'cabal upload' option: '--doc': upload documentation to
	hackage (#2890).
	* Improved error handling for 'sandbox delete-source' (#2943).
	* Solver support for extension and language flavours (#2873).
	* Support for secure repos using hackage-security (#2983).
	* Added a log file message similar to one printed by 'make' when
	building in another directory (#2642).
	* Added new subcommand 'init' to 'cabal user-config'. This
	subcommand creates a cabal configuration file in either the
	default location or as specified by --config-file (#2553).
	* The man page for 'cabal-install' is now automatically generated
	(#2877).
	* The '--allow-newer' option now works as expected when specified
	multiple times (#2588).
	* New config file field: 'extra-framework-dirs' (extra locations
	to find OS X frameworks in). Can be also specified as an argument
	for 'install' and 'configure' commands (#3158).
	* It's now possible to limit the scope of '--allow-newer' to
	single packages in the install plan (#2756).
	* Full '--allow-newer' syntax is now supported in the config file
	(that is, 'allow-newer: base, ghc-prim,  some-package:vector')
	(#3171).
	* Improved performance of '--reorder-goals' (#3208).
	* Fixed space leaks in modular solver (#2916, #2914).
	* Made the solver aware of pkg-config constraints (#3023).
	* Added a new command: 'gen-bounds' (#3223). See
	http://softwaresimply.blogspot.se/2015/08/cabal-gen-bounds-easy-generation-of.html.
	* Tech preview of new nix-style isolated project-based builds.
	Currently provides the commands (new-)build/repl/configure.
