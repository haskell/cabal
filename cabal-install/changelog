2.4.2.0 TBD
	* Fix `--with-compiler` failing to locate compiler on Windows
	  without explicit `.exe` suffix
	* Make parsing of cabal script metadata block more robust in
	  the presence of whitespace (#5775) and fail loudly in case
	  of missing or not properly terminated script metadata blocks
	* Fix Shebang detection heuristics and properly support passing
	  through program arguments to Shebang cabal scripts (#5600)
	* Fix misplaced creation of `dist/` folders in CWD (#3699)
	* Make v2-install/new-install-specific flags configurable in
	  ~/.cabal/config
	* Add --copy-bindir and --bindir-method=copy flags to v2-install
	  that copy the executable instead of symlinking it

2.4.1.0 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> November 2018
	* Add message to alert user to potential package casing errors. (#5635)
	* new-clean no longer deletes dist-newstyle/src with `-s`. (#5699)
	* 'new-install' now warns when failing to symlink an exe (#5602)
	* Extend 'cabal init' support for 'cabal-version' selection (#5567)
	* 'new-sdist' now generates tarballs with file modification
	  times from a date in 2001. Using the Unix epoch caused
	  problems on Windows. (#5596)
	* Register monolithic packages installed into the store due to a
	  build-tool dependency if they also happen to contain a buildable
	  public lib. (#5379,#5604)
        * Fixed a Windows bug where cabal-install tried to copy files
          after moving them (#5631).
        * 'cabal v2-repl' now works for indefinite (in the Backpack sense) components. (#5619)
	* Set data dir environment variable for tarballs and remote repos (#5469)
	* Fix monolithic inplace build tool PATH (#5633)
	* 'cabal init' now supports '-w'/'--with-compiler' flag (#4936, #5654)
	* Fix ambiguous --builddir on new-install (#5652)
	* Allow relative --storedir (#5662)
	* Respect --dry on new-install (#5671)
	* Warn when new-installing zero exes (#5666)
	* Add 'pkg-cabal-sha256' field to plan.json (#5695)
	* New v2-build flag: '--only-configure'. (#5578)
	* Fixed a 'new-install' failure that manifested when it
	  encountered remote source dependencies in a project. (#5643)
	* New 'v2-[build,configure' flag: '--write-ghc-environment-files'
	  to control the generation of .ghc.environment files. (#5711)

2.4.0.0 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> September 2018
	* Bugfix: "cabal new-build --ghc-option '--bogus' --ghc-option '-O1'"
	  no longer ignores all arguments except the last one (#5512).
	* Add the following option aliases for '-dir'-suffixed options:
	  'storedir', 'logsdir', 'packagedir', 'sourcedir', 'outputdir' (#5484).
	* 'new-run' now allows the user to run scripts that use a special block
	  to define their requirements (as in the executable stanza) in place
	  of a target. This also allows the use of 'cabal' as an interpreter
	  in a shebang line.
	* Add aliases for the "new-" commands that won't change when they
	  lose their prefix or are eventually replaced by a third UI
	  paradigm in the future. (#5429)
	* 'outdated' now accepts '--project-file FILE', which will look for bounds
	  from the new-style freeze file named FILE.freeze. This is only
	  available when `--new-freeze-file` has been passed.
	* 'new-repl' now accepts a '--build-depends' flag which accepts the
	  same syntax as is used in .cabal files to add additional dependencies
	  to the environment when developing in the REPL. It is now usable outside
	  of projects. (#5425, #5454)
	* 'new-build' now treats Haddock errors non-fatally. In addition,
	  it attempts to avoid trying to generate Haddocks when there is
	  nothing to generate them from. (#5232, #5459)
	* 'new-run', 'new-test', and 'new-bench' now will attempt to resolve
	  ambiguous selectors by filtering out selectors that would be invalid.
	  (#4679, #5461)
	* 'new-install' now supports installing libraries and local
	  components. (#5399)
	* Drop support for GHC 7.4, since it is out of our support window
	  (and has been for over a year!).
	* 'new-update' now works outside of projects. (#5096)
	* Extend `plan.json` with `pkg-src` provenance information. (#5487)
	* Add 'new-sdist' command (#5389). Creates stable archives based on
	  cabal projects in '.zip' and '.tar.gz' formats.
	* Add '--repl-options' flag to 'cabal repl' and 'cabal new-repl'
	  commands. Passes its arguments to the invoked repl, bypassing the
	  new-build's cached configurations. This assures they don't trigger
	  useless rebuilds and are always applied within the repl. (#4247, #5287)
	* Add 'v1-' prefixes for the commands that will be replaced in the
	  new-build universe, in preparation for it becoming the default.
	  (#5358)
	* 'outdated' accepts '--v1-freeze-file' and '--v2-freeze-file'
	  in the same spirit.
	* Completed the 'new-clean' command (#5357). The functionality is
	  equivalent to old-style clean, but for nix-style builds.
	* Ensure that each package selected for a build-depends dependency
	  contains a library (#5304).
	* Support packages from local tarballs in the cabal.project file.
	* Default changelog generated by 'cabal init' is now named
	  'CHANGELOG.md' (#5441).
	* Align output of 'new-build' command phases (#4040).
	* Add suport for specifying remote VCS dependencies via new
	  'source-repository-package' stanzas in 'cabal.project' files
	  (#5351).

2.2.0.0 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> March 2018
	* '--with-PROG' and '--PROG-options' are applied to all packages
	and not local packages only (#5019).
	* Completed the 'new-update' command (#4809), which respects nix-style
	cabal.project(.local) files and allows to update from
	multiple repositories when using overlays.
	* Completed the 'new-run' command (#4477). The functionality is the
	same of the old 'run' command but using nix-style builds.
	Additionally, it can run executables across packages in a project.
	Tests and benchmarks are also treated as executables, providing a
	quick way to pass them arguments.
	* Completed the 'new-bench' command (#3638). Same as above.
	* Completed the 'new-exec' command (#3638). Same as above.
	* Added a preliminary 'new-install' command (#4558, nonlocal exes
	part) which allows to quickly install executables from Hackage.
	* Set symlink-bindir (used by new-install) to .cabal/bin by default on
	.cabal/config initialization (#5188).
	* 'cabal update' now supports '--index-state' which can be used to
	roll back the index to an earlier state.
	* '--allow-{newer,older}' syntax has been enhanced. Dependency
	relaxation can be now limited to a specific release of a package,
	plus there's a new syntax for relaxing only caret-style (i.e. '^>=')
	dependencies (#4575, #4669).
	* New config file field: 'cxx-options' to specify which options to be
	passed to the compiler when compiling C++ sources specified by the
	'cxx-sources' field. (#3700)
	* New config file field: 'cxx-sources' to specify C++ files to be
	compiled separately from C source files. Useful in conjunction with the
	'cxx-options' flag to pass different compiler options to C and C++
	source files. (#3700)
	* Use [lfxtb] letters to differentiate component kind instead of
	opaque "c" in dist-dir layout.
	* 'cabal configure' now supports '--enable-static', which can be
	used to build static libaries with GHC via GHC's `-staticlib`
	flag.
	* 'cabal user-config now supports '--augment' which can append
	additional lines to a new or updated cabal config file.
	* Added support for '--enable-tests' and '--enable-benchmarks' to
	'cabal fetch' (#4948).
	* Misspelled package-names on CLI will no longer be silently
	case-corrected (#4778).
	* 'cabal new-configure' now backs up the old 'cabal.project.local'
	file if it exists (#4460).
	* On macOS, `new-build` will now place dynamic libraries into
	`store/lib` and aggressively shorten their names in an effort to
	stay within the load command size limits of macOSs mach-o linker.
	* 'new-build' now checks for the existence of executables for
	build-tools and build-tool-depends dependencies in the solver
	(#4884).
	* Fixed a spurious warning telling the user to run 'cabal update'
	when it wasn't necessary (#4444).
	* Packages installed in sandboxes via 'add-source' now have
	their timestamps updated correctly and so will not be reinstalled
	unncecessarily if the main install command fails (#1375).
	* Add Windows device path support for copyFile, renameFile. Allows cabal
	new-build to use temporary store path of up to 32k length
	(#3972, #4914, #4515).
	* When a flag value is specified multiple times on the command
	line, the last one is now preferred, so e.g. '-f+dev -f-dev' is
	now equivalent to '-f-dev' (#4452).
	* Removed support for building cabal-install with GHC < 7.10 (#4870).
	* New 'package *' section in 'cabal.project' files that applies
	options to all packages, not just those local to the project.
	* Paths_ autogen modules now compile when `RebindableSyntax` or
	`OverloadedStrings` is used in `default-extensions`.
	[stack#3789](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/3789)
	* `getDataDir` and other `Paths_autogen` functions now work correctly
	when compiling a custom `Setup.hs` script using `new-build` (#5164).

2.0.0.1 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> December 2017
	* Support for GHC's numeric -g debug levels (#4673).
	* Demoted 'scope' field version check to a warning (#4714).
	* Fixed verbosity flags getting removed before being passed to
	'printPlan' (#4724).
	* Added a '--store-dir' option that can be used to configure the
	location of the build global build store (#4623).
	* Turned `allow-{newer,older}` in `cabal.project` files into an
	accumulating field to match CLI flag semantics (#4679).
	* Improve success message when `cabal upload`ing documentation
	(#4777).
	* Documentation fixes.

2.0.0.0 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> August 2017
	* See http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2017-09-09-Cabal-2-0.html
	for more detailed release notes.
	* Removed the '--root-cmd' parameter of the 'install' command
	(#3356).
	* Deprecated 'cabal install --global' (#3356).
	* Changed 'cabal upload' to upload a package candidate by default
	(#3419). Same applies to uploading documentation.
	* Added a new 'cabal upload' flag '--publish' for publishing a
	package on Hackage instead of uploading a candidate (#3419).
	* Added optional solver output visualisation support via the
	tracetree package. Mainly intended for debugging (#3410).
	* Removed the '--check' option from 'cabal upload'
	(#1823). It was replaced by package candidates.
	* Fixed various behaviour differences between network transports
	(#3429).
	* The bootstrap script now works correctly when run from a Git
	clone (#3439).
	* Removed the top-down solver (#3598).
	* The '-v/--verbosity' option no longer affects GHC verbosity
	(except in the case of '-v0'). Use '--ghc-options=-v' to enable
	verbose GHC output (#3540, #3671).
	* Changed the default logfile template from
	'.../$pkgid.log' to '.../$compiler/$libname.log' (#3807).
	* Added a new command, 'cabal reconfigure', which re-runs 'configure'
	with the most recently used flags (#2214).
	* Added the '--index-state' flag for requesting a specific
	version of the package index (#3893, #4115).
	* Support for building Backpack packages.  See
	https://github.com/ezyang/ghc-proposals/blob/backpack/proposals/0000-backpack.rst
	for more details.
	* Support the Nix package manager (#3651).
	* Made the 'template-haskell' package non-upgradable again (#4185).
	* Fixed password echoing on MinTTY (#4128).
	* Added a new solver flag, '--allow-boot-library-installs', that allows
	any package to be installed or upgraded (#4209).
	* New 'cabal-install' command: 'outdated', for listing outdated
	version bounds in a .cabal file or a freeze file (#4207).
	* Added qualified constraints for setup dependencies. For example,
	--constraint="setup.bar == 1.0" constrains all setup dependencies on
	bar, and --constraint="foo:setup.bar == 1.0" constrains foo's setup
	dependency on bar (part of #3502).
	* Non-qualified constraints, such as --constraint="bar == 1.0", now
	only apply to top-level dependencies. They don't constrain setup or
	build-tool dependencies. The new syntax --constraint="any.bar == 1.0"
	constrains all uses of bar.
	* Added a technical preview version of the 'cabal doctest' command
	(#4480).

1.24.0.2 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> December 2016

	(#3506).
	* Store secure repo index data as 01-index.* (#3862).
	* Added new hackage-security root keys for distribution with
	cabal-install.
	* Fix an issue where 'cabal install' sometimes had to be run twice
	for packages with build-type: Custom and a custom-setup stanza
	(#3723).
	* 'cabal sdist' no longer ignores '--builddir' when the package's
	build-type is Custom (#3794).

	* If there are multiple remote repos, 'cabal update' now updates
	them in parallel (#2503).

	either curl or wget or, on Windows, PowerShell, under the hood (#2687).
	* Install target URLs can now use https e.g. 'cabal install
	https://example.com/foo-1.0.tar.gz'.
	* Automatically use https for cabal upload for the main
	hackage.haskell.org (other repos will use whatever they are
	configured to use).
	* Support for dependencies of custom Setup.hs scripts
	(see http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/cabal-setup-deps/).
	* 'cabal' program itself now can be used as an external setup
	method. This fixes an issue when Cabal version mismatch caused
	unnecessary reconfigures (#2633).
	* Improved error message for unsatisfiable package constraints
	(#2727).
	* Fixed a space leak in 'cabal update' (#2826).
	* 'cabal exec' and 'sandbox hc-pkg' now use the configured
	compiler (#2859).

	default location or as specified by --config-file (#2553).
	* The man page for 'cabal-install' is now automatically generated
	(#2877).
	* The '--allow-newer' option now works as expected when specified
	multiple times (#2588).
	* New config file field: 'extra-framework-dirs' (extra locations
	to find OS X frameworks in). Can be also specified as an argument
	for 'install' and 'configure' commands (#3158).
	* It's now possible to limit the scope of '--allow-newer' to
	single packages in the install plan (#2756).
	* Full '--allow-newer' syntax is now supported in the config file
	(that is, 'allow-newer: base, ghc-prim,  some-package:vector')
	(#3171).
	* Improved performance of '--reorder-goals' (#3208).
	* Fixed space leaks in modular solver (#2916, #2914).
	* Made the solver aware of pkg-config constraints (#3023).
