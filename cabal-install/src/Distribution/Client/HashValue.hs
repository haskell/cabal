-- The specific choice of hash implementation
--

-- Is a crypto hash necessary here? One thing to consider is who controls the
-- inputs and what's the result of a hash collision. Obviously we should not
-- install packages we don't trust because they can run all sorts of code, but
-- if I've checked there's no TH, no custom Setup etc, is there still a
-- problem? If someone provided us a tarball that hashed to the same value as
-- some other package and we installed it, we could end up re-using that
-- installed package in place of another one we wanted. So yes, in general
-- there is some value in preventing intentional hash collisions in installed
-- package ids.

-- Cannot do any sensible validation here. Although we use SHA256
-- for stuff we hash ourselves, we can also get hashes from TUF
-- and that can in principle use different hash functions in future.
--
-- Therefore, we simply derive this structurally.
