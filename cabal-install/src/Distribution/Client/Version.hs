-- This value determines the `cabal-install --version` output.

-- It is used in several places throughout the project, including anonymous build reports, client configuration,
-- and project planning output. Historically, this was a @Paths_*@ module, however, this conflicted with
-- program coverage information generated by HPC, and hence was moved to be a standalone value.
