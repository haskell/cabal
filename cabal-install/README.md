The cabal-install package
=========================

See the [Cabal web site] for more information.

The `cabal-install` package provides a command line tool named `cabal`.
It uses the Cabal library and provides a user interface to the
Cabal/Hackage build automation and package management system. It can
build and install both local and remote packages, including
dependencies.
