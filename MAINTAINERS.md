## List of Maintainers

a.k.a. The Cabal Maintainers Team:

* Mikolaj Konarski ([`@Mikolaj`](https://github.com/Mikolaj))

* Francesco Ariis ([`@ffaf1`](https://github.com/ffaf1))

* Artem Pelenitsyn ([`@ulysses4ever`](https://github.com/ulysses4ever))

* Brandon Allbery ([`@geekosaur`](https://github.com/geekosaur))

### How we compose this list

The main goal of the team is to make sure Cabal is keeping up with the ever-evolving Haskell ecosystem.
In practical terms this means producing releases of the packages in this repository on a regular basis (we release at least as often as does GHC).

The people listed above (in chronological order by when they joined the team) are volunteers currently carrying out the release procedures.
Of course, releases don't happen in a vacuum, and successful development of Cabal requires coordination.
For this reason, the team holds regular (biweekly) video calls with agenda prepared asynchronously in a Markdown document, which also holds the meeting notes. For the record, the meetings are open to everyone interested in Cabal, especially aspiring and returning Cabal contributors.

If you want to become a Cabal maintainer as described above, i.e. contribute to the biweekly meetings (synchronously or asynchronously through the meeting document or the Matrix chat) and perform some of the release tasks, get in touch: open a GitHub discussion or send a message in our Matrix chat referenced in the README.
