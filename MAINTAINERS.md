### How we compose this list

The main goal of the team is to ensure that Cabal is keeping up with the ever-evolving Haskell ecosystem.
In practical terms this means producing releases of the packages in this repository on a regular basis: we usually have to release at least as often as does GHC due to an intimate connection between the compiler and the build system.
Hence, the people listed above (in chronological order by when they joined the team) are those who are currently available for carrying out the release procedures.

Successful maintenance requires coordination, and the team engages in three main ways:

- attending to issues and PRs on GitHub;

- discussing Cabal on the [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#hackage:matrix.org);

- meeting biweekly in video calls with agenda prepared asynchronously in a Markdown document, which also holds the meeting notes.

Worth noting that the meetings are open to everyone interested in Cabal, especially aspiring and returning Cabal contributors. Ask on Matrix how to join.

Most of the current team are volunteers, and we are happy to receive any help.
If you want to participate in Cabal maintenance as defined above (e.g. take on some release tasks), get in touch: open a GitHub discussion or send a message on Matrix.
