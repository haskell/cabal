Changes in 1.6.16
  * Fixes to accomodate GHC 8.4

Changes in 1.6.13
  * Parse things like <function> and <Function> as constructors

Changes in 1.6.12
  * Treat reserved operators as infix constructors (best effort kind of thing)

Changes in 1.6.11
  * Add `pPrint`, which is `putStrLn . ppShow`

Changes in 1.6.10
  * Increase the precedence of unary minus

Changes in 1.6.9
  * Relax parsing of atoms, so that we can support things like the show
    instance of StdGen (e.g., [ 123 45, 786 10 ])

Changes in 1.6.8.2:
  * Correct license in srouce files.

Changes in 1.6.8.1:
  * Correct the 'License' field in the Cabal file to match the license (MIT)

Changes in 1.6.8:
  * Move source-repository pragma to top-level.

Changes in 1.6.5:
  * Rename CHANGES to CHANGELOG to work with hackage.

Changes in 1.6.4:
  * Drop dependency on happy >= 1.19

Changes in 1.6.3:
  * Add Safe Haskell annotations
  * Add CHANGES file
  * Add generated parser to package again.  We do this, because otherwise
    the package fails to build on systems that do not have `happy`.
    This is a bit questionable, but hopefully it won't be too much of
    a problem.
