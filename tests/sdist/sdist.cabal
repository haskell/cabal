-- This is a test to make sure we're including all sections into the sdist
-- irrespective of the buildable status.
-- So the test passes if the tarball includes both Exe1.hs and Exe2.hs

Executable exe1
    Main-Is: Exe1.hs
    Build-Depends: base

Executable exe2
    Main-Is: Exe2.hs
    Build-Depends: base
    if !os(linux)
      Buildable: False
