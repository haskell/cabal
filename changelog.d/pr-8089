synopsis: Fix Cabal not finding public sublibraries of installed packages
packages: Cabal
prs: #8089
issues: #7270

description: {

Fix bug in lookup of installed sublibraries with nonexact dependencies (ie. when
not using --exact-configuration). That is the mode of operation of distribution
packages, so this should allow distros to package Cabal packages with multiple
libraries.
