description: {

- When v2-install runs on a library, it does not pin global packages in the env file, only those directly necessary for the library.

-- Further, it now fails if there is a reinstall in the plan, and suggests the --force-reinstalls flag, which also now works, cleaning out previous entries from the env file for any target which is reinstalled.

}
