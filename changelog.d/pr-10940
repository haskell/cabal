After #10507, cabal prints out what project files are in use on every run.
This looked too noisy for some users (#10885). In this patch, we implement a more nuanced
strategy: print out this info only when cabal is run below the root project directory.
As before, you can get this information uncoditionally if run in the verbose mode.

Bonus: we now also print the project root directory along with the file names.
Before, we only printed, say, `cabal.project`, but it wasn't clear where this file is
coming from (can be anywhere up the directory tree).
The change tries to avoid confusion when cabal picks up stray project files in
ancestor directories, see discussion in #7930.
