synopsis: Existence of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cabal/config now overrides existence of $HOME/.cabal
packages: cabal-install
issues: #8577

description: {

To avoid pre-XDG backwards compatibility from triggering due to other
tools accidentally creating a $HOME/.cabal directory, the presence of
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cabal/config now disables pre-XDG backwards
compatibility.  Presumably $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cabal/config will never be
created by accident.
