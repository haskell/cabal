`cabal gen-bounds` now works in multi-package projects.

The command has been reimplemented to use the cabal.project infrastructure (similar
to other v2 commands), allowing it to be aware of all packages defined in the cabal.project
file, regardless of which directory it's executed from.

```
$ cat cabal.project
packages: package-a/
          package-b/

$ cd package-b/
$ cabal gen-bounds
Configuration is affected by the following files:
- cabal.project
Resolving dependencies...

The following packages need bounds and here is a suggested starting point...
For component package-b:lib:package-b:
package-a >= 0.1.0 && < 0.2,
```
