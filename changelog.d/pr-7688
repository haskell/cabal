synopsis: Add code-generators field to test-suite stanza
packages: Cabal
prs: #7688
issues: #4500

description: {

Test-suite stanzas now may contain a `code-generators:` field that can be used to run executables as preprocessors which take existing locations of library code and cabal-generated ghc build flags, and output new modules for use in the test stanza. This can be used to automatically generate drivers for "discover" style tests, including doctests.
