description: {
Add support for profiled dynamic way

New options for cabal.project and ./Setup interface:

* `profiling-shared`: Enable building profiling dynamic way
* Passing `--enable-profiling` and `--enable-executable-dynamic` builds
  profiled dynamic executables.

Support for using `profiling-shared` is guarded behind a constraint
which ensures you are using `Cabal >= 3.13`.

In the cabal file:

* `ghc-prof-shared-options`, for passing options when building in
  profiling dynamic way
