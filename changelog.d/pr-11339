synopsis: Add `--version-full` option and move additional version information to it

A new option `--version-full` has been added to `cabal` and `Setup.hs`. The previously added git revision information has been moved to it, and compiler and host information added to it.

The `--version` option now reports the same information it originally did, in case scripts were relying on its output.

Git revision information still is not provided for release builds, largely to avoid bootstrapping issues when building GHC. (Both cabal-install (not distributed, but used by hadrian) and the Cabal library are built as part of GHC builds.)

This _shouldn't_ affect most people, unless someone has been relying on the output of `--version` instead of using `--numeric-version`; but they would have been forced to support both output forms, and that only if supporting unreleased cabal builds.
