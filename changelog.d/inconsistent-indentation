synopsis: Warn about inconsistent indentation

description:
    Make Cabal warn about inconsistent indentation in .cabal files.

    For example warn about somewhat common decreasing indentation like in

    ```cabal
    library
        default-language: Haskell2010
      build-depends: base
      ghc-options: -Wall
    ```

    The change is `readFields` function.

    This is an effect of using `indentOfAtLeast` method/approach: any indentation greater than current offset is accepted.

    That behavior is desirable to parsing multiline field contents, but it is a bit surprising for fields in sections, which we expect to be aligned.

    Such insonsistency seems to be always a mistake, and it's easy to fix once a machine points it out.
