synopsis: Apply command line flags to install packages
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8779
issues: #8637

description: {

- Command line flags usually only apply to "local" packages (packages specified
  in the cabal.project). This change causes the v2-install command to ignore
  that distinction to better match the expected behavior for packages specified
  directly in the command.

}
