We now correctly pin the Cabal unit ID to the one that Cabal-hooks depends on
when using build-type: Hooks. This avoid strange error messages like

```
SetupHooks.hs: error: [GHC-83865]
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Distribution.Verbosity.Verbosity’
                  with actual type ‘Verbosity’
      NB: ‘Distribution.Verbosity.Verbosity’
            is defined in ‘Distribution.Verbosity’ in package ‘Cabal-3.16.0.0’
          ‘Verbosity’
            is defined in ‘Distribution.Verbosity’ in package ‘Cabal-3.16.0.0’
```

where the error is that there are two different unit IDs for `Cabal` being
passed when compiling the `SetupHooks` module.
