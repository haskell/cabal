synopsis: Add separate cache for getPkgConfigDb
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9422
issues: #8930

description: {
  Querying pkg-config for the version of every module can be a very expensive
  operation on some systems. This change adds a separate, per-project, cache for
  pkgConfigDB; reducing the cost from "every plan change" to "every pkg-config-db
  change per project". A notice is also presented to the user when refreshing the
  packagedb.
