For GHC 8.4.4 and later, Cabal now passes the `-package-env=-` flag to GHC.
This prevents the `GHC_ENVIRONMENT` variable or any package environment files
from affecting Cabal builds.

This change eliminates unexpected build behavior that could occur when users
had GHC environment files configured in their system that Cabal wasn't aware
of.
