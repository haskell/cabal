synopsis: Fix extra-prog-path propagation
packages: cabal-install Cabal
prs: #9527
issues: #7649 #9519

description: {

- extra-prog-paths are now propagated to all commands. This in particular helps
  when running a MinGW cabal in the PowerShell, where the MSYS2 paths are
  usually not available in the PowerShell PATH. GHCup already sets them up for
  us but they were sometimes lost on the way.
