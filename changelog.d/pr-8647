synopsis: No up-front warning that assertions are on for special commands (help, version, numeric-version)
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8647
issues: #8645

description: {

- When compiled with ghc option `-fno-ignore-assert`, `cabal-install` will issue a generic warning that assertions are on.
  This warning will no longer be emitted for special modes of operation like `cabal --numeric-version`, `--version` and help,
  and also not if `cabal` could not parse its command line.
  Further, the warning now goes to `stderr` rather than `stdout`.

}
