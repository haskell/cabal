synopsis: Fix haddock interface and HTML paths for sub-libraries

Previously, `cabal haddock --haddock-all` could not find the `.haddock` interface
file for internal sub-libraries, causing missing documentation and "could not
find link destinations" warnings. This was because the registered
`haddockInterfaces` and `haddockHTMLs` paths in `generalInstalledPackageInfo`
did not include the sub-library name subdirectory.
