synopsis: changes to haddock-project command

packages: cabal-install
prs: #8919
issues: #8843 #8958
description: {

- cabal haddock-project by default creates self contained
  documentation (formerly it required `--local` switch, which is removed).
- `--gen-contents`, `--gen-index`, `--quickjump` and `--hyperlinked-source`
  options where removed as they are always passed to haddock.
- Fixes a bug which prevented to use `haddock-project` with
  packages containing sublibraries.
