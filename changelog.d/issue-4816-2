synopsis: Fix interaction of `--*-shared` and `--*-executable-dynamic` options.
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9900
issues: #10050

description: {

If you explicitly request `--disable-shared` it should disable the building of
a shared library and override any automatic ways this option is turned on.

Passing `--enable-executable-dynamic` turns on `--enable-shared` if the option is
not specified explicitly.

Before this patch, writing `--disable-shared` on its own would not disable the building of shared libraries. Writing `--disable-shared` and `--disable-executable-dynamic` would disable shared library
creation (despite `--disable-executable-dynamic` being the default).

Now:

* If you specify `--enable-shared` then shared objects are built.
* If you specify `--disabled-shared` then shared objects are not built.
* If you don't explicitly specify whether you want to build shared libraries then
  * `--enable-executable-dynamic` will automatically turn on building shared libraries
  * `--enable-executable-dynamic --enable-profiling` will automatically turn on building
    shared profiling libraries (if supported by your compiler).
