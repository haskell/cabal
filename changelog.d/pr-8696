synopsis: Extend the InstalledPackageInfo record with fields for artifacts.
packages: Cabal-syntax Cabal Cabal-tests
prs: #8696
description: {
    Extend the InstalledPackageInfo record with new fields involving build
    artifact configuration.  The moduler resolver could then (in a separate set
    of changes) use these new fields to avoid selecting installed package
    options missing required artifacts and producing build plans that would
    fail, even if alternatives would succeed.
