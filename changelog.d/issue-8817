description: {

Adds the `extra-files` field to the cabal file specification. This is like
the other `extra-*` fields in that it is copied with the `sdist` command,
except there are no other semantics. Compare to:

* `extra-source-files`: Tracked by `cabal build`.

* `extra-doc-files`: Copied by Haddock to the html directory.
