synopsis: Make Setup copy/install succeed when there's no executable or library
packages: Cabal
prs: #9926
issues: #6750

description: {
  Historically the Setup copy and install steps would fail if the package didn't
  contain an executable or library component. In this case there's nothing to do.

  This required workarounds for downstream users of Cabal to handle this edge case.
  Now that this error has been downgraded to a warning, Cabal will succeed if 
  there's nothing to do.
