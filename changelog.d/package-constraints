synopsis: Implement `package-constraints` field
packages: Cabal-syntax
prs: #9462

description: {

The new `package-constraints` stanza can be used to default versions that are
ommitted in the build-depends fields. This could be done previously by means of
common stanzas but it was too verbose and obscure (dependencies came sometimes
from stanzas).

}
