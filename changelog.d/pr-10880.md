synopsis: 'Fix multi-repl when using reexported-modules with renaming for GHC >= 9.12'

Since GHC 9.12, the `-reexported-module` flag has supported module renaming. Therefore
we now use that functionality when starting the multi-repl if it is needed. A new
error message is added to catch the case where you attempt to load a project which
uses this complicated export form but are using < 9.12.
