synopsis: Warn early that overwrite policy is needed
description:
  Waiting for a long build and then seeing the install fail because a flag was
  missing is frustrating.  With this change we skip the wait and warn early,
  before the build, that an overwrite policy flag would be needed for the
  install to succeed.
