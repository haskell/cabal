synopsis: Warn when project configuration options are going to be ignored.
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8949

description: {

Some project configuration options can only be specified from the command line.
If the user specified those options from a project file, cabal-install would
silently ignore them. Now cabal-install will emit a warning.
