synopsis: "Fix duplicate environment variables in test and benchmark runs"

Cabal no longer creates duplicate environment variables when running test
suites, benchmarks, or internal executables. Previously, when setting up the
environment for these processes, Cabal would append the overridden environment
to the existing environment, creating duplicates of the same variable.
