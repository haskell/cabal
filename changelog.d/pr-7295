synopsis: Add 'preferred-versions' support for LocalIndexRepo
packages: cabal-install
prs: #7295
issues: #7294

description: {

- Previously, the only repo-index-type that reads the preferred-versions file is `RepoRemote`.
  `LocalIndexRepo` now also supports parsing `preferred-versions` file, main purpose is to write tests.
  As a nice side-effect, users can provide their own overlay over package sets to restrict or prefer certain package versions.

}
