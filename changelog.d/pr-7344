description: {

- Restructures the `cabal init` command to fix historical
  issues. All flags are preserved.
  - Codebases for interactive and non-interactive flags
    are disentangled.
  - Data structures now exploit relevant stanza structure
    and formatters only care about stanza data
  - Heuristics and prompts have a pure and impure implementation.

- Sets default behavior to be `--interactive` as opposed to
  `--non-interactive`.

- Rewrites tests to achieve 98% coverage
  - Golden files now test every stanza individually
  - Every flag is covered by a unit test
  - Interactive, simple, and non-interactive workflows are
    covered.
