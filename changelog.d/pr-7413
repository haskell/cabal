synopsis: Fix instantiating an indefinite Backpack from Hackage with an inplace package
packages: cabal-install
prs: #7413
issues: #6835
description: {

Previously, cabal-install would always attempt to put instantiations of indefinite packages from Hackage in
the global package store, even if they were instantiated with inplace packages.  This would not work
and GHC would complain about packages being missing from the package database.  We have fixed the
instantiation algorithm to correctly inplace packages in these situations, removing one of the last
blockers to widespread use of Backpack packages on Hackage.
