synopsis: Add 'preferred-versions' support for LocalIndexRepo
packages: cabal-install
prs: #7296
issues: #7249, #5603

description: {

- `cabal outdated` honours the 'preferred-versions' file which might deprecate or prefer certain
  versions of packages. In particular, if the only newer version of a package has been deprecated,
  `cabal outdated` should not report that there are newer versions available.
