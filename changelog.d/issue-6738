synopsis: Add support for authentication tokens for uploading to Hackage
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9058
issues: #6738

description: {

A new flag `--token` (`-t`) has been created. Token authentication takes 
precedence over username and password meaning that, if a token is set, 
the username and password flags are ignored.
