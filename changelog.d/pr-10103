synopsis: Enhance error detection for cabal root project files, including broken symlinks

packages: cabal-install

prs: #10103

issues: #9937

description: {

- Added proper detection and reporting for issues with cabal root project files. Previously, these files were silently ignored if they were broken symlinks. Now, `cabal` will exit 
with an error in such case.

}
