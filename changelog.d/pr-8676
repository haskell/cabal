synopsis: Adds functionality for the --offline flag with the "build" command.
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8676

description: {
    The --offline flag previously created in #2578 but was only implemented for the install command even thought the flag didn't throw an error whenever the build command was run. This PR adds functionality for the --offline flag with the build command.
Additionally there is a new PackageTest for the flag using the build command.
