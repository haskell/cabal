synopsis: use `nroff -man | less` instead of `man` as backend for `cabal man`
packages: cabal-install
issues: #7714
prs: #7726
description: {

The previous implementation of `cabal man` used `man` as backend to
view the generated manpage file.  However, macOS' and BSD's `man` does
not accept a file as input, so `cabal man` was broken on macOS and
BSD.

The issue has been fixed by piping the generated manpage through
`nroff -man` and then into `$PAGER` which defaults to `less`.  Thus,
`cabal man` now works both on Linux and macOS/BSD.

NB: `cabal man` requires `nroff` to be installed which is the case for
standard setups (but may not be case on slim setups like VMs used in
CI).  Note that `nroff` is not necessarily a prerequisite of a package
containing `man`.
