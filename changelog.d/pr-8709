synopsis: Add warning for running cabal run, cabal test and cabal bench with +RTS flag
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8709

description: {

This adds a warning when RTS options are passed to cabal instead of the binary 
for the commands 'run', 'bench' and 'test', as most users want to pass these 
options to their binary.

}
