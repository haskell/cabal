synopsis: Add `cabal path` command
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8879

description: {

The `cabal path` command prints the file system paths used by Cabal.
It is intended for use by tooling that needs to read or modify Cabal
data, such that it does not need to replicate the complicated logic
for respecting `CABAL_DIR`, `CABAL_CONFIG`, etc.
