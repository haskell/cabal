synopsis: clarify Cabal "configure" messages
packages: Cabal
prs: #9476

synopsis: {

	Cabal can issue a number of error messages referencing "Setup configure",
	but it simply references "configure" which could mean any of three
	things (Setup configure, the package's "configure" script, or "cabal
	configure"). This has recently caught out even Cabal devs. Clarify these
	messages.
