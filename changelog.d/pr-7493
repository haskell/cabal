synopsis: Fix `cabal test --enable-library-coverage` for other-modules

description: {

- Fix `cabal test --enable-library-coverage` for libraries with nonempty other-modules field.
- Due to a hack, this breaks coverage whenever the used Haskell compiler is called 't' (for a non-hacky fix we should rework HPC directories, possibly enabling multilib in the process, see #6440 and #6397).
