synopsis: Print out which project file we are using with the default verbosity
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10507
issues: #8519

description: {

- Many people have been burnt by cabal catching stray project files located up
  the directory tree. This change tries to protect them at the expense of
  producing more output by default. In particular, before this change, you could
  see which project file is in use by supplying `-v` (the verbose mode), and
  after the change we print this information with the default verbosity.
  Changing the behaviour of cabal is out of scope of this change, and will
  hopefully be done in the future versions (see #9353 for a way forward).
