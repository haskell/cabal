synopsis: Fix behaviour of --disable-shared
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10054
issues: #10050

description: Previously `--disable-shared` was not applied unless `--disable-executable-dynamic` was
also explicitly configured.

Now `--disable-shared` will turn off building shared libraries irrespective of whether
`--disable-executable-dynamic` is specified.
