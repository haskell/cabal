synopsis: Solver: shorten the skipping message if needed
packages: cabal-install-solver
prs: #11062

When the solver fails to find a solution, it can print out a long list
of package versions which failed to meet the requirements. This PR
shortens the message to at most 3 versions which failed to meet the
requriements.
