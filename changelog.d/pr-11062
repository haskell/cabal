synopsis: Solver: shorten the skipping message if needed
packages: cabal-install-solver
prs: #11062

When the solver fails to find a solution, it can print out a long list
of package versions which failed to meet the requirements. This PR
shortens the message price the one version that failed and the number
of other versions which failed to meet the requriements.
