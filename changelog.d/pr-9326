synopsis: Include the GHC "Project Unit Id" in the cabal store path
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #9326
issues: #8114
description: {
- This allows the use of several **API incompatible builds of the same version
  of GHC** without corrupting the cabal store.
- This relies on the "Project Unit Id" which is available since GHC 9.8.1,
  older versions of GHC do not benefit from this change.
