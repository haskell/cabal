synopsis: Handle conditionals in duplicate module checks
packages: Cabal
prs: #7616
issues: #4629 #7525

description: {

Improves `cabal check` logic for duplicate modules to take into account conditional branches. If a module appears on both sides of an `if/else` clause in a cabal file, it is now correctly not reported as a duplicate.
