OpenBSD's `--strip-unneeded` thinks some symbols are unneeded that are in fact
needed when C bits are involved, so suppress its use.

Taken from the OpenBSD ports repo (https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/lang/ghc/patches/patch-libraries_Cabal_Cabal_Distribution_Simple_Program_Strip_hs);
brought to our attention by maerwald.
