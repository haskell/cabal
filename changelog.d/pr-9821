synopsis: `haddock-project` support for subcomponents
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9821
issues:
significance: significant

description: {

- `haddock-project` handles sublibraries, test suites and benchmarks.
- `haddock` receives `--package-name` flag whcih allows to set names of
  components which are included in the main `index.html` file.
- added `--use-unicode` flag to `haddock` and `haddock-project` commands.
- The directory structure of `./dist-newstyle` has changed.  `haddock`
  subcommand will install `package:sublib` component in a directory
  `package/sublib` under `l/sublib/doc/html/`.  This is important for
  `haddock-project` command and in the future might will be useful for hackage
  support of sublibraries.  See
