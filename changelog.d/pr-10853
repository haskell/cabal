synopsis: Monitor `ghc.shim` on Windows
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10853
issues: #10850

description: {

- On Linux it is the `ghc` executable that changes when changing compiler
  version in GHCup (the symlink points to a new location) but on Windows it is
  the companion `ghc.shim` file that changes. This file is now also monitored
  for changes to trigger rebuilds.
