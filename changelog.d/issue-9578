synopsis: Show provenance of project constraints
description:
  Show imports when the solver rejects a package version due to a project
  constraint.  Even though imports are relative to their parent when imported,
  their paths are shown relative to the directory of the project in the solver
  output.

  ```
  $ cabal build all --dry-run
  ...
  [__1] next goal: hashable
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.3.0
        (constraint from cabal.project requires ==1.4.2.0)
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.2.0
        (constraint from project-stackage/nightly-2023-12-07.config requires ==1.4.3.0)
          imported by: cabal.project
  ```

  Fixes some test failures detecting cycles in imports, when;
  
  - the wrong import was reported as starting the cycle
  - a cycle was reported that wasn't actually a cycle
