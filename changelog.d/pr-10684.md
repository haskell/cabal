synopsis: "A project target is required for the REPL command"

With a project, the REPL command requires a target. If one is not given then a
message is shown explaining this and naming the project if the `--project-file`
option was given (but not when the default 'cabal.project' project name is used
implicitly).  We're not yet able to list project targets so in the meantime, the
messages lists the packages of the project.

* When the implicit default `cabal.project` is used:

```
$ cat cabal.project
packages: pkg-one pkg-two

$ cabal repl
Error: [Cabal-7076]
With a project, the REPL command requires a single target. The packages in this project are:
 - pkg-one
 - pkg-two
```

* When the `--project-file` option is used, the file name is included:

```
$ cat some.project
packages: pkg-one pkg-two

$ cabal repl --project-file=some.project
...
Error: [Cabal-7076]
With a project, the REPL command requires a single target. The packages in this project, 'some.project', are:
 - pkg-one
 - pkg-two
```

* When the project has no packages, this is mentioned in the message:

```
$ cat empty.project

$ cabal repl --project-file=empty.project
...
Error: [Cabal-7076]
With a project, the REPL command requires a single target but there are no
packages in this project, 'empty.project', to choose a package (library) or
other component from as the target for this command.
```

* Before the fix the message mentioned a `fake-package-0`. This was confusing:

```
$ ~/.ghcup/bin/cabal-3.12.1.0 repl --project-file=some.project
...
Error: [Cabal-7076]
Internal error when trying to open a repl for the package fake-package-0. The
package is not in the set of available targets for the project plan, which would
suggest an inconsistency between readTargetSelectors and resolveTargets.
```

* Earlier `cabal-install:exe:cabal` versions mentioned using `all` as the target,
  but this won't work for the REPL command:

```
$ ~/.ghcup/bin/cabal-3.10.3.0 repl --project-file=some.project
Error: cabal-3.10.3.0: No targets given and there is no package in the current
directory. Use the target 'all' for all packages in the project or specify
packages or components by name or location. See 'cabal build --help' for more
details on target options.
```
