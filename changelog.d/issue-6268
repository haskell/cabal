synopsis: Fix parsing of password-command option
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9002
issuesa: #6268

description: {

The password-command option did not parse its value correctly.
Quotes were ignored, making many kinds of commands impossible to
express (e.g.  `sh -c "foo | bar"`).  Also, `cabal user-config`
treated the argument list as a *list of option values*, rather than a
*value that is a list*.  As a consequence, `cabal user-config
update` corrupted the value in the config file.

Fixed these issues by parsing the command as a space separated list
of tokens (which may be enclosed in double quotes), and treating the
parsed list-of-token as one value (not multiple).
