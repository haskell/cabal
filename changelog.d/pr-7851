description: {

- Script support improved or added across relevant commands.
- `cabal run script` will now cache results and will not do a fresh build every time.
- `cabal build script` added. It will build the cache for script.
- `cabal repl script` added. It will open a repl for script using the cache if available.
- `cabal clean script` added. It will clean the cache for script.
- `cabal clean` will now remove script caches for which there is no marching script.
- `cabal list-bin` now works with scripts
- The name of the generated script executable has been changed from "script" to
  "cabal-script-<your-sanitized-script-name>" for easier process management.
- Reduce the default verbosity of scripts, so that the build output doesn't interfere with the script output.
- Scripts now support a project metadata block that allows them to use options
  that would normally be set in a cabal.project file.
