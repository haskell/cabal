synopsis:  Better support for scripts
packages: cabal-install
prs: #7851
issues: #7842 #6354 #6149.

description: {

- Script support improved or added across relevant commands.
- `cabal run script` will now cache results and will not do a fresh build every time.
- `cabal build script` added. It will now build the cache for script.
- `cabal clean script` added. It will now clean the cache for script and prune orphaned script caches.
- `cabal repl script` added. It will now work as expected, but with a separate cache from run and build for technical reasons.
