synopsis: Allow reinstalling packages like base and template-haskell for GHC>=9.14

description: {

Historically cabal-install disallowed reinstalling packages like `base` and `template-haskell`.
As of GHC-9.12, the reasons for this have been lifted.
We update cabal-install to become aware of this and allow reinstalling more packages.
Certain packages like `ghc` and `ghc-internal` still cannot be reinstalled.

}
