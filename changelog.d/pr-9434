synopsis: Fix the platform string for GNU/Hurd
packages: Cabal
prs: #9434

description: {

Depending who you ask, GNU/Hurd will be labelled "gnu" or "hurd". The autotools
use "gnu", so ghc follows this for installed files, even if the ghc source code
uses OSHurd. We thus need to add the translation between the two.
