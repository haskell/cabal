synopsis: Use ghc -flink-rts option when available

description: {

Previously Cabal did quite some headstands to link against libHSrts.
Note only this is complex but it couples very tightly to GHC's implementation.
Thankfully, as of GHC 9.0 GHC provides a -flink-rts flag for precisely this purpose.
Use it when available.

It fixed a bug which make Cabal unusable to build foreign libraries for windows and ghc 9.0 or 9.2.
