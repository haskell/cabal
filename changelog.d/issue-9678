synopsis: Clarify the semantics of the -package-db flag

description: {

The `--package-db` flag now only applies to the default
immutable initial package stack rather than also applying to the store
package database.

This fixes an assertion failure which was triggered when using -package-db and also
clarifies how it should interact with `--store-dir` and `--dist-dir` flags.
