synopsis: Adjust BSD-2-Clause and BSD-3-Clause licence text
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9813
issues: #9812

description: {

This change matters to BSD-2-Clause and BSD-3-Clause licences. For these two
licences, `cabal init` created a licence file that slightly differed from
wording published at SPDX.  This has been rectified.
