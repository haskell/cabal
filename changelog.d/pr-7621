synopsis: Backtrack when no pkg-config is present
packages: Cabal

description: {

When solving for pkgconfig-depends, when pkg-config is not present, the cabal solver will now backtrack and try a different automatic flag and dependency configuration, just as it does if pkg-config is present, but does not contain the specified package.

}
