synopsis: Filter out dinitial-unique and dunique-increment from package hash
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10122

description: {

`-dinitial-unique` and `-dunique-increment` are now filtered out when computing the
store hash of a package.

These options shouldn't affect the output of the package and hence
shouldn't affect the store hash of a package.

}
