synopsis: Add LexBraces lexer warning
packages: Cabal-syntax
issues: #8577

description: {

LexBraces warning is issued when brace delimiting syntax is used.
This way, using `readFields'`, a low-lever consumer may decide
whether braces were used.

(Looking for a brace character in the input is imprecise, as braces can occur inside field content).

This warning is not propagated to parser warnings,
so e.g. readGenericPackageDescription doesn't warn about it.
This is because all parser warnings prevent uploads to Hackage,
and using braces (or not) is opinionated choice.
