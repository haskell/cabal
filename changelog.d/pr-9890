synopsis: `cabal init` generates explicit export lists for Main
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9890
issues: #9889

description: {

- Lack of explicit export list can degrade performance. The `Main` module in particular should always have an explicit export list that contains just the main function. Then, the compiler can do more aggressive optimizations on all the other non-exported functions.

}
