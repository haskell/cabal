synopsis: Shorten script-builds paths
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #8898
issues: #8841

description: {

- Use Base64 hash truncated to 26 chars for script-build cache directories.
- Use the cache directory as the dist directory.
- Use script-<your-sanitized-script-name> as the component name instead of cabal-script-<...>.
- Use cabal-script-<your-actual-script-name> for the executable name.
- This change is incompatible with previous cabal versions in terms of cache location,
  you should manually remove your old caches once you no longer need them.
