synopsis: Add support for loading multiple components into one repl session
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8726 #8238 #8491

description: {

The `repl` command is extended in order to allow starting a repl session with
multiple local components. When a user specifies a target to the "repl" command
which resolves to multiple local components then `cabal` will start a repl session
which loads them all into a single GHC session if the multi-repl is enabled.

The multi-repl can be enabled by passing `--enable-multi-repl`, or writing `multi-repl: True` in
your cabal.project file.

The feature is fully explained in [this blog post](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/03/cabal-multi-unit/).
