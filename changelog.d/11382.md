Aside from being faster, by using uv to build the user guide:

* We don't have to explicitly activate a python virtual environment, either in the shell or in our makefile.
* A clean git clone can `make users-guide` without first `make users-guide-requirements`.
* We require fewer variables, targets and recipes in the the makefiles.
* The `make users-guide` recipe output is much shorter as it doesn't include lengthy pip output.
