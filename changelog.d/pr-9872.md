synopsis: Batched (and eventually parallel) compilation of extra-sources

All C sources for a component are now compiled with a single one-shot (the `-c`
option) GHC invocation, rather than one-per-source, and ditto for each other
type of extra-source. In addition, `--semaphore` now propagates `-jsem` to these
GHC invocations if working with a GHC that supports this (see
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/12388/ for the status of
that support).
