synopsis: Fix links to installed documentation when running `cabal haddock`
packages: Cabal
prs: #11218

Links to installed documentation (i.e. for base) from generated haddocks should
now work.

The `pkgroot` variable wasn't being expanded when reading the `haddock-html` field
from a package description.
