synopsis: Reimplementing `cabal check`
packages: Cabal
prs: #8427
issues: #7423

description: {

- For `cabal-install` users: `cabal check` do not warn on -O2 or similar
  options if under an off-by-default cabal flag.
- For `Cabal` the library users: `checkPackage` signature has been simplified,
  you do not need to pass a specific configuration of the package, since
  we do not flatten GenericPackageDescription no more.
- For `Cabal` the library users: `checkPackageFileNames` has been removed,
  use `checkPackageFiles` instead.
- For `Cabal` the library users: `checkPackageFilesGPD` has been introduced,
  a function similar to `checkPackageFiles` that works on
  `GenericPackageDescription`. You do not need to use
  `flattenPackageDescription` anymore.
