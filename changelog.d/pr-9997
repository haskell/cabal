synopsis: Suppress ghc-pkg warnings emitted when an empty packages is being registered
packages: Cabal
prs: #9997

description: {

When a package contains a library that has no modules, `./Setup register`
tries to register the library with fields `haddock-interfaces:` and
`haddock-html:` pointing at non-existent files or directories, and `ghc-pkg
register` warns about them.

To suppress the warnings prevent these fields from being generated when
there are no modules.

}
