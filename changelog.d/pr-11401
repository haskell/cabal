synopsis: Fix the OS string encoding for GNU/Hurd
packages: Cabal
prs: #11401

description: {

Following https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/9434/files , and as seen
in the various gnu_HOST_OS usages in the ghc source code, it is expected that
GNU/Hurd is advertised as "gnu", so the OS String encoding for OSHurd was
updated into "gnu".

}
