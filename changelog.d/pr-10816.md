synopsis: "Add checks for Windows reserved filenames in module paths"
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #10816
issues: #10295

description: {

On Windows, certain filenames are reserved by the operating system such as
"aux", "con", "prn", "nul", etc. When these names appear in module paths they
can cause build failures on Windows systems.

`cabal check` now properly warns about module paths that contain Windows reserved
filenames, not just filepaths which contain these reserved tokens. These warnings
are controlled by the existing `invalid-win-path` category.

For example, module paths like:
- `Exe.Aux.Test`
- `Test.Aux.Module`
- `Bench.Aux.Helpers`

will now trigger appropriate warnings during `cabal check`.
