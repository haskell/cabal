synopsis: Add option to ./Setup repl to write repl arguments to file
packages: Cabal
prs: #8726

description: {

The `./Setup repl` command is modified to allow a user to defer
starting the repl and instead instruct the command to write the
necessary build flags to a directiory. The option is called
`--repl-multi-file <DIR>`.

This is useful when starting multi-component sessions as we want to query Setup.hs
for the arguments which are needed to build each component but not for ./Setup to
start the repl itself.
