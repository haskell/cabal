synopsis: Revert renaming from #10546
packages: cabal-install-solver
prs: #10546

description: {

https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/10546 changed the Solver API by
renaming a function and was backported to 3.14 in
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/10753. In particular,
`docProjectConfigPaths` was renamed to `docProjectConfigFiles`.
This change reverts the renaming but not anything else from #10546.

}
