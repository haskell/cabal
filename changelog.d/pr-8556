synopsis: Add installDirs (datadir, etc) to v2-build and remove them from v2-install
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8556
significance: significant

description: {

- Passes through --prefix --datadir and other installdir arguments properly in v2-build, allowing its use in perparing somewhat more relocatable compilation targets (no worse than v1-build).
- Removes these flags (which never worked) from v2-install

}
