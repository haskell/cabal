description: {

- ghc 9.12 adds several new command line options, divided between
  `LANGUAGE`s (already added), warnings, new preprocessor control options,
  and compilation control options. Two options needed to be added to the
  list of options requiring `Int` parameters.

  The new options, excluding warning and language options, are:

  * `-fexpose-overloaded-unfoldings`
  * `-fmax-forced-spec-args=N`
  * `-fno-expose-overloaded-unfoldings`
  * `-fno-object-determinism`
  * `-fobject-determinism`
  * `-fwrite-if-compression=N`
  * `-optCmmP…`
  * `-optJSP…`
  * `-pgmCmmP`
  * `-pgmJSP`

  As they all affect compilation and store hashes, the only necessary
  change was to list the two numeric options so they will be parsed
  correctly. To the best of our understanding, `-pgm*` and `-opt*`
  options are already handled as a group.
