./configure scripts run by build-type: Configure will now be passed the CXX and
CXXFLAGS variables. These reflect the path and flags for the C++ compiler.

If the compiler is not available, then the flags are not passed. For GHC versions >= 9.4.*,
the CXX variable will always be set and available to be used.

This can be useful for implementing something like `system-cxx-std-lib` in user-land.
