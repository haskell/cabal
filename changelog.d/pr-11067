synopsis: `cabal update`: create default config without comment about `builddir`
packages: cabal-install
prs: #11067
issues: #11050
description: {
When calling `cabal update` with an empty state (empty `CABAL_DIR` or new
machine), cabal writes out a default config file with many fields
commented out to show their defaults. This suggests that the user can
uncomment the field and override the default. This is wrong for fields
that aren't allowed in the config file like `builddir`. This patch
avoids generating a comment with `builddir` in the default config.
