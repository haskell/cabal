synopsis: Do not always pass --quickjump to haddock #9049
packages: Cabal
prs: #9049
issues: #9060
description: {

6d8adf13101 caused `cabal` to always pass the `--quickjump` flag to Haddock.
Not only does this waste memory for a service that user hasn't asked for,
but also leads to a failure with Haddocks shipped with GHC 9.0 and 9.2,
which had a separate bug (fixed in later versions but not backported) when
Haddock does not pass `--quickjump` recursively to the package dependencies.
