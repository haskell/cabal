synopsis: Drop file and module targets
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #8966

description: {

- The ability to specify a single file or a single module as a target has been
  removed since no versions of Cabal ever supported this feature; and cabal-install
  would always fallback to targeting (e.g. building) the whole component.

  If you were using a target syntax that includes a file or module name, you
  can remove them expecting no change in behaviour. In some cases this will
  cause the target to become ambiguous, and you will have to specify the
  component instead.

  Another minor change is that it is now possible to use `cabal run` against a
  source file which is part of a component. The file will be considered like
  any other and will need the metadata block.
