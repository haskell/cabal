synopsis: Make --(test-)show-details=direct the default
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #8942

description: {

This option leaves it up to the testing framework to decide what and how to print out,
potentially leading to a prettier output. For example, most of the testing frameworks
use colors, which wouldn't be seen with any other option.

This comes with a tradeoff, though: Cabal will not create a log file with this option.
If you prefer a log file, consider setting `--test-show-details=streaming` (or something
else) manually.
