Added a `--lock` flag to `cabal freeze`, to promote a freeze file to a lock file. By calling `cabal freeze --lock`, the resulting freeze file will ensure that only dependencies whose constraints are specified, will be accepted by future build plans. This flag can be used to ensure that no unaudited packages are added to the build plan.

This new `--lock` flag reuses the mechanism behind `--reject-unconstrained-dependencies`, by writing the equivalent of `--reject-unconstrained-dependencies=all` to the freeze file.
