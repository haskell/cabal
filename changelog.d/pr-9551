  Introduction of a new build type: Hooks.
  This build type, intended as replacement to the Custom build type, integrates
  better with the rest of the ecosystem (`cabal-install`, Haskell Language Server).

  The motivation and full design of this new build-type are specified in the
  Haskell Foundation Tech Proposal
  [Replacing the Cabal Custom build-type](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/60).

  Package authors willing to use this feature should declare `build-type: Hooks`
  in their `.cabal` file, declare a custom-setup stanza with a dependency on the
  `Cabal-hooks` package, and define a module `SetupHooks` that exports a value
  `setupHooks :: SetupHooks`, using the API exported by `Distribution.Simple.SetupHooks`
  from the `Cabal-hooks` package. Refer to the Haddock documentation of
  `Distribution.Simple.SetupHooks` for example usage.
