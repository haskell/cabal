synopsis: Add `--semaphore` flag to enable interaction with GHC Job Server protocol
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8557

description: {

When cabal-install is passed the `--semaphore` flag it will now act as a job server
according to the GHC Jobserver Protocol.

In particular this means that cabal-install will create a semaphore which it then
passes to `./Setup build` (and hence `ghc`) which can be used by `ghc` in order to
control how much paralellism it uses, coordinating with other simultaneously running
processes.

This feature requires ghc-9.8 in order to use, as this is the first version of GHC
which implements the protocol.

The protocol is specified by [GHC Proposal #540](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0540-jsem.rst).
