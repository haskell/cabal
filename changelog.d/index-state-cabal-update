synopsis: Reject index-state younger than cached index file
packages: cabal-install
prs: #8944

description: {

Requesting to use an index-state younger than the cached version will now fail,
telling the user to use an index-state older or equal to the cached file, or to
run `cabal update`.

The warning for a non-existing index-state has been also demoted to appear only
on verbose logging.

}
