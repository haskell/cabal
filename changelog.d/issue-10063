synopsis: External commands now propagate exit code from child process
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10100
issues: #10063

description: {
  The exit code from an external command is now propagated as the exit code of
  cabal-install when invoked by calling an external command.

  For example, if your external command exits with code 1, then cabal-install will
  also exit with code 1.

  This mechanism can be used by an external command to signal failure.
