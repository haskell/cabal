The `cabal` program has no problem building packages where the name of the Cabal
file is different from the package name. The same was not true when it came to
installing such a package or uploading it to Hackage, since the Cabal file was
be added to the source distribution archive as-is.

Now, `cabal sdist` adds the Cabal file named as `PACKAGE_NAME.cabal` to the
source distribution archive. This has the following consequences:

  * If you use for example a canonical name for your Cabal files like
    `package.cabal`, then you are now able to use `cabal install` or upload it
    to Hackage.

  * If you relied on the fact that the name of the Cabal file in the created
    source distribution archive matches the one in the filesystem, then this is
    not true anymore.

    TODO: Explain how/if it is possible to restore the old behaviour!
