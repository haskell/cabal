synopsis: "Use response files when calling `ghc`"
packages: [Cabal]
prs: 9367
---

Cabal now passes GHC arguments through a response file. This prevents an error
where very large packages would fail to build due to the module names exceeding
the `ARG_MAX` command-line length limit:

```
ghc: createProcess: posix_spawnp: resource exhausted (Argument list too long)
```

Notes:
- Response files will not be used if the first argument to `ghc` is
  `--interactive`.
- RTS options (like `+RTS -H32m -S -RTS`) will not be included in response
  files.
- For reproducing commands after Cabal exits, `--keep-temp-files` can be used
  to prevent the response files from being deleted.
