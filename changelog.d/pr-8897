synopsis: Make check comply with Hackage requirements
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #8897

description: {

- `cabal check` will only return exitcode 1 when the package is not fit
  for Hackage. E.g. it will not error anymore when your `synopsis:` is
  larger than `description:`, just emit a warning.
- Cabal: Distribution.Client.Check now exports `isHackageDistError`, for
  third-party tools to know if a specific error will preclude a package
  from being uploaded to Hacakge.

}
