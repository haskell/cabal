When solving dependencies fails, constraints will be labeled with their source.
For example, in this error message, a `source-repository-package` in
`cabal.project` has fixed the version of `memory` to `0.17.0`:

```
[__0] rejecting: memory-0.18.0
  (constraint from cabal.project requires ==0.17.0)
```

Previously, these error messages would just specify that the constraint came
from a "user target", which was unclear and misleading:

```
[__0] rejecting: memory-0.18.0 (constraint from user target requires ==0.17.0)
```
