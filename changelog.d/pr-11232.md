Previously the executable name of the external command was passed to external commands as the first argument.

This behaviour was adapted from cargo which does this because of reasons that are internal to rust that do not affect GHC Haskell, and are even orthogonal to patterns that see common use in Haskell.

Additionally, it complicates the 'simple' case which is what we should optimize for when building such a feature - with this change, for any executable `cabal-foo` in your search-path, `cabal foo` will be a valid invocation of that command.

The previous use case (one executable that serves multiple external subcommands) is still possible by the following means:

- using a wrapper around the executable
- using a symlink and check argv\[0\] in the executable
