synopsis: Fixes incorrect handling of git branches in source-repository-package
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9154
issues: #6888

description: {

The source-repository-package stanza in a cabal.project file allows a
user to specify a git branch to check out. However, cabal incorrectly
interpreted the branch as a git tag, and thus this feature did not
work as expected. This pr fixes this; i.e. a git branch specified in a
source-repository-package stanza is now actually treated as a branch.
