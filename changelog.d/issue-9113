synopsis: Fix handling of ETag header for remote packages
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9116
issues: #9113

description: {

Remote packages will now be cached regardless of the capitalization of the
"ETag" header. Previously remote packages would not be cached if the header
name did not match exactly. Now they will be cached even if the header's
capitalization is different.

}
