synopsis: Merge globbing implementations
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #9673
issues: #5349

description: {

The common aspects of the globbing functionality between `Cabal` and
`cabal-install` have been factored out. The only change in the user-facing API
is that we now record when a glob does not match exactly, but matches a
directory with that same name, with the new constructor `GlobMatchesDirectory`
of `GlobResult`.

To illustrate, this change means that when `foo/dir` is a directory, the glob
`*/dir/` matches exactly `foo/dir` (as before), but now
`*/dir` produces `GlobMatchesDirectory` instead of failing.
This allows callers to decide whether to allow or discard such inexact matches.
