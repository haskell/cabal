synopsis: Configure build-type in terms of Hooks
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #9969

description: {

The `build-type: Configure` is now implemented in terms of `build-type: Hooks`
rather than in terms of `build-type: Custom`. This moves the `Configure`
build-type away from the `Custom` issues. Eventually, `build-type: Hooks` will
no longer imply packages are built in legacy-fallback mode. Now, when that
happens, `Configure` will also stop implying `legacy-fallback`.

The observable aspect of this change is `runConfigureScript` now having a
different type, and `autoconfSetupHooks` being exposed `Distribution.Simple`.
The former is motivated by internal implementation details, while the latter
provides the `SetupHooks` value for the `Configure` build type, which can be
consumed by other `Hooks` clients (e.g. eventually HLS).
