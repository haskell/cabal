synopsis: Ignore invalid Unicode in pkg-config descriptions
packages: cabal-install-solver
prs: #9609
issues: #9608

description: {

Previously, cabal-install would crash when `pkg-config --list-all` contained
invalid Unicode. With this change, invalid unicode in package descriptions is
ignored, and unparseable package names are considered nonexistent.

}
