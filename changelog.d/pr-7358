description {

- Exposes `cabal-install` as a library, bumping the `cabal-install` cabal version to 2.2, and removing the dogfooding framework surrounding `cabal-install` to facilitate easier testing.

- Moves `cabal-install-solver` out to its own directory, and treats it as its own separate project. Addresses #6090, #7224, and #3781

- Enable HPC coverage:

  - absorb `cabal-install-solver-dsl` module into the test modules, and
    incorporate it into its own test target.

  -  Splits out `cabal-install` unit tests from long-running tests.

  - Adds proper subcomponent coverage masking so we can finally generate
    baseline coverage reports for `cabal-install`.
