synopsis: Implement `default-package-bounds` field
packages: Cabal-syntax
prs: #9462

description: {

The new `default-package-bounds` stanza can be used to default versions that are
ommitted in the build-depends fields. This could be done previously by means of
common stanzas, but it was too verbose and obscure (dependencies came sometimes
from stanzas).
