synopsis: Remove warning on option -threaded when building libraries
packages: Cabal
prs: #8432
issues: #8431 #774

description: {

- Accompanied by option `-flink-rts`, option `-threaded` defines the flavour of
  the ghc RTS library the built library will be linked against. Note that bare
  ghc does not warn when option `-threaded` is used for building a library
  either.
- Note that the changes require modification of the regression check for issue
  #774 which can be regarded as a proper test for this PR.
