Extend the flag `reject-unconstrained-dependencies` to have options
`none|all|eq`.

When set to `eq` or `all`, all non-local packages that aren't goals must be
explicitly constrained. The difference between `all` and `eq` is that `all`
accepts any version constraint (even `>0`) but `eq` accepts only version ranges
that normalise to an equality constraint (== v).
