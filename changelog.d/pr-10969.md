`cc-options`, `cxx-options`, `jspp-options`, `asm-options`,
`cmm-options`, `ld-options`, `cpp-options`,
gccProgram(`-pgmc`) should be always passed when invoking GHC,
similarly as `ghc-options` should be always used when
invoking `ghc` - regardless of what is the intention of a particular GHC-call.
GHC might use or not use the options, Cabal cannot know and should not guess.

`cc-options` and `cxx-options` still need to be separated (C/C++) for versions below 8.10.

gccProgram till need to be separated (C/C++) for versions below 9.4.
