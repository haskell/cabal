`cc-options`, `cxx-options`, `jspp-options`, `asm-options`,
`cmm-options`, `ld-options`, `cpp-options`,
gccProgram(`-pgmc`) should be always passed when invoking GHC,
similarly as `ghc-options` should be always used when
invoking `ghc` - regardless of what is the intention of a particular GHC-call.
GHC might use or not use the options, Cabal cannot know and should not guess.

[Historical note]
Before `ghc` 8.10, `cc-options` and `cxx-options` were split into one flag `-optc`,
then in 8.10 they started to split into `-optc` and `-optcxx`, cabal picked up
this change and started to give flags separately not only for new versions,
but also for old ones. That is, now for 8.8 we send `-optc` flags separately for
different sources.

`cc-options` and `cxx-options` still need to be separated (C/C++) for versions below 8.10.

gccProgram till need to be separated (C/C++) for versions below 9.4.
