synopsis: Add --semaphore option to ./Setup build interface
packages: Cabal
prs: #8557

description: {

When `./Setup build --semaphore <SEM>` is called, `ghc` will be called with the
`-jsem` option. It is the responsibility of the caller of `./Setup build` to
manage the semaphore according to the GHC Jobserver Protocol.

This low level interface is intended to be called by a high-level tool such as
`cabal-install` which can create and manage the semaphore appropriately.

The protocol is specified by [GHC Proposal #540](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0540-jsem.rst).
