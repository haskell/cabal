description: {

- Run a program (named "preBuildHook") before doing a package build and another program
  (named "postBuildHook") after the package is built.
- These programs are project local and need to be in the `cabalHooks` directory which is
  in the same directory as the `cabal.project` file.
- The absence of these programs will be ignored.
- How to check and run these hooks securely is specified in the documentation.
