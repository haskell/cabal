synopsis:      A framework for packaging Haskell software
description:
  The Haskell Common Architecture for Building Applications and
  Libraries: a framework defining a common interface for authors to more
  easily build their Haskell applications in a portable way.
  .
  The Haskell Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing,
  organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and tools.
