-- This provides an abstraction which deals with configuring and running
-- programs. A 'Program' is a static notion of a known program. A
-- 'ConfiguredProgram' is a 'Program' that has been found on the current
-- machine and is ready to be run (possibly with some user-supplied default
-- args). Configuring a program involves finding its location and if necessary
-- finding its version. There's reasonable default behavior for trying to find
-- \"foo\" in PATH, being able to override its location, etc.

  --
  -- It is supplied with the prevailing search path which will typically

  -- located the program (and perhaps identified its version). For example
  -- it could add args, or environment vars.

-- | A search path to use when locating executables. This is analogous
-- to the unix @$PATH@ or win32 @%PATH%@ but with the ability to use
-- the system default method for finding executables ('findExecutable' which
-- on unix is simply looking on the @$PATH@ but on win32 is a bit more
-- complicated).
--
-- The default to use is @[ProgSearchPathDefault]@ but you can add extra dirs
-- either before, after or instead of the default, e.g. here we add an extra
-- dir to search after the usual ones.
--
-- > ['ProgramSearchPathDefault', 'ProgramSearchPathDir' dir]
--
-- We also use this path to set the environment when running child processes.
--
-- The @ProgramDb@ is created with a @ProgramSearchPath@ to which we
-- @appendProgramSearchPath@ to add the ones that come from cli flags and from
-- configurations. Then each of the programs that are configured in the db
-- inherits the same path as part of @configureProgram@.
