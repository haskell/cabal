0.4  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org> Sun Jan 16 2005

	* Much thanks to all the awesome fptools hackers who have been
	working hard to build the Haskell Cabal!

	* Interface Changes:

	** WARNING: this is a pre-release and the interfaces are still
	likely to change until we reach a 1.0 release.

	** Instead of Package.description, you should name your
	description files <something>.cabal.  In particular, we suggest
	that you name it <packagename>.cabal, but this is not enforced
	(yet).  Multiple .cabal files in the same directory is an error,
	at least for now.

	** ./setup install --install-prefix is gone.  Use ./setup copy
	--copy-prefix instead.

	** The "Modules" field is gone.  Use "hidden-modules",
	"exposed-modules", and "executable-modules".

	** Build-depends is now a package-only field, and can't go into
	executable stanzas.  Build-depends is a package-to-package
	relationship.

	** Some new fields.  Use the Source.

	* New Features

	** Cabal is now included as a package in the CVS version of
	fptools.  That means it'll be released as "-package Cabal" in
	future versions of the compilers, and if you are a bleeding-edge
	user, you can grab it from the CVS repository with the compilers.

	** Hugs compatibility and NHC98 compatibility should both be
	improved.

	** Hooks Interface / Autoconf compatibility: Most of the hooks
	interface is hidden for now, because it's not finalized.  I have
	exposed only "defaultMainWithHooks" and "defaultUserHooks".  This
	allows you to use a ./configure script to preprocess
	"foo.buildinfo", which gets merged with "foo.cabal".  In future
	releases, we'll expose UserHooks, but we're definitely going to
	change the interface to those.  The interface to the two functions
	I've exposed should stay the same, though.

	** ./setup haddock is a baby feature which pre-processes the
	source code with hscpp and runs haddock on it.  This is brand new
	and hardly tested, so you get to knock it around and see what you
	think.

	** Some commands now actually implement verbosity.

	** The preprocessors have been tested a bit more, and seem to work
	OK.  Please give feedback if you use these.

0.3  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org> Sun Jan 16 2005
	* Unstable snapshot release
	* From now on, stable releases are even.

0.2  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org>

	* Adds more HUGS support and preprocessor support.
