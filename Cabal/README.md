Your help
---------

To help Cabal's development, it is enormously helpful to know from
Cabal's users what their most pressing problems are with Cabal and
[Hackage]. You may have a favourite Cabal bug or limitation. Look at
Cabal's [bug tracker]. Ensure that the problem is reported there and
adequately described. Comment on the issue to report how much of a
problem the bug is for you. Subscribe to the issues's notifications to
discussed requirements and keep informed on progress. For feature
requests, it is helpful if there is a description of how you would
expect to interact with the new feature.
