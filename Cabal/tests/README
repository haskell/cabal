Building and running the test suite
===================================

You can build and run the test suite by running:

    cabal configure && cabal build
    cd tests
    cabal configure --package-db=../dist/package.conf.inplace \
        --constraint='Cabal == 1.9.1'
    cabal build
    cd ..
    tests/dist/build/suite/suite
                        (because suite.hs starts by 'cd'ing into 'tests')

Replace the Cabal constraint with whatever the current development
version of Cabal.
