    -- In abstract, the Cabal test suite makes calls to the "Setup"

    -- responsible for building this executable in the first place,
    -- since (1) Cabal doesn't support a test-suite depending on an
    -- executable, so we can't put a "Setup" executable in the Cabal
    -- file and then depend on it, (2) we don't want to call the Cabal
    -- functions *directly* because we need to capture and save the
    -- stdout and stderr, and (3) even if we could do all that, we will
    -- want to test some Custom setup scripts, which will be specific to
    -- the test at hand and need to be compiled against Cabal.
    --
    -- To be able to build the executable, there is some information

    --      all of the necessary dependencies to make our Cabal package
    --      well-formed.
    --
    -- We could have the user pass these all in as arguments,  but
    -- there's a more convenient way to get this information: the *build
    -- configuration* that was used to build the Cabal library (and this
    -- test suite) in the first place.  To do this, we need to find the

-- | Guess what the 'dist' directory Cabal was installed in is.  There's

--
--     1. Test programs are ~always built in-place, in a directory
--        that looks like dist/build/package-tests/package-tests;
--        thus the directory can be determined by looking at $0.
--        This method is robust against sandboxes, Nix local
--        builds, and Stack, but doesn't work if you're running
--        in an interpreter.
--
--     2. We can use the normal input methods (as per Cabal),
--        checking for the CABAL_BUILDDIR environment variable as
--        well as the default location in the current working directory.
--
-- NB: If you update this, also update its copy in cabal-install's
