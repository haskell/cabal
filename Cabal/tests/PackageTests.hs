    -- In abstract, the Cabal test suite makes calls to the "Setup"
    -- executable and tests the output of Cabal.  However, we have to
    -- responsible for building this executable in the first place,
    -- since (1) Cabal doesn't support a test-suite depending on an
    -- executable, so we can't put a "Setup" executable in the Cabal
    -- file and then depend on it, (2) we don't want to call the Cabal
    -- functions *directly* because we need to capture and save the
    -- stdout and stderr, and (3) even if we could do all that, we will
    -- want to test some Custom setup scripts, which will be specific to
    -- the test at hand and need to be compiled against Cabal.
    --
    -- To be able to build the executable, there is some information
    -- we need:
    --
    --      1. We need to know what ghc to use,
    --
    --      2. We need to know what package databases (plural!) contain
    --      all of the necessary dependencies to make our Cabal package
    --      well-formed.
    --
    -- We could have the user pass these all in as arguments (TODO: this
    -- should be an option),  but there's a more convenient way to get
    -- this information: the *build configuration* that was used to
    -- build the Cabal library (and this test suite) in the first place.
    -- To do this, we need to find the 'dist' directory that was set as
    -- the build directory for Cabal.

    -- all the relevant parameters you might still succeed.

    -- have to be careful: some tests might depend on the Cabal library,
    -- in which case you REALLY need to have built and installed Cabal
    -- for the version that the test suite is being built against.  The
    -- easiest thing to do is make sure you built Cabal the same way as
    -- you will run the tests.

    -- The packageDBStack is worth some commentary.  The database

    -- THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM.  The package database stack
    -- controls where we install a package; specifically, the package is
    -- installed to the top-most package on the stack (this makes the
    -- most sense, since it could depend on any of the packages below
    -- it.)  If the test wants to register anything (as opposed to just
    -- working in place), then we need to have another temporary
    -- database we can install into (and not accidentally clobber any of
    -- the other stacks.)  This is done on a per-test basis.
    --
    -- ONE MORE THING. On the subject of installing the package (with
    -- copy/register) it is EXTREMELY important that we also overload
    -- the install directories, so we don't clobber anything in the
    -- default install paths.  VERY IMPORTANT.

-- | Guess what the 'dist' directory Cabal was installed in is.  There's
-- no 100% reliable way to find this, but there are a few good shots:
--
--     1. Test programs are ~always built in-place, in a directory
--        that looks like dist/build/package-tests/package-tests;
--        thus the directory can be determined by looking at $0.
--        This method is robust against sandboxes, Nix local
--        builds, and Stack, but doesn't work if you're running
--        in an interpreter.
--
--     2. We can use the normal input methods (as per Cabal),
--        checking for the CABAL_BUILDDIR environment variable as
--        well as the default location in the current working directory.
--
-- NB: If you update this, also update its copy in cabal-install's IntegrationTests

-- | Like Distribution.Simple.Configure.getPersistBuildConfig but

-- we run Cabal's own test suite, due to bootstrapping issues.
-- Here's the situation:
--
--      1. There's some system Cabal-1.0 installed.  We use this
--         to build Setup.hs
--      2. We run ./Setup configure, which uses Cabal-1.0 to
--         write out the LocalBuildInfo
--      3. We build the Cabal library, whose version is Cabal-2.0
--      4. We build the package-tests executable, which LINKS AGAINST
--         Cabal-2.0
--      5. We try to read the LocalBuildInfo that ./Setup configure
--         wrote out, but it's Cabal-1.0 format!
--
-- It's a bit skeevy that we're trying to read Cabal-1.0 LocalBuildInfo
-- using Cabal-2.0's parser, but this seems to work OK in practice
-- because LocalBuildInfo is a slow-moving data structure.  If
-- we ever make a major change, this won't work, and we'll have to
-- take a different approach (either setting "build-type: Custom"
-- so we bootstrap with the most recent Cabal, or by writing the
