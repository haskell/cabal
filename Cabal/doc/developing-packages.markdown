% Cabal User Guide: Developing Cabal packages


# Quickstart #


Lets assume we have created a project directory and already have a
Haskell module or two.

Every project needs a name, we'll call this example "proglet".

~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cd proglet/
$ ls
Proglet.hs
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is assumed that (apart from external dependencies) all the files that
make up a package live under a common project root directory. This
simple example has all the project files in one directory, but most
packages will use one or more subdirectories. See section [TODO](#TODO)
for the standard practices for organising the files in your project
directory.

To turn this into a Cabal package we need two extra files in the
project's root directory:

 * `proglet.cabal`: containing package metadata and build information.
 * `Setup.hs`: containing any customisation of the build system.

We can create both manually or we can use `cabal init` to create them
for us.

### Using "cabal init" ###

The `cabal init` command is interactive. It asks us a number of
questions starting with the package name and version.

~~~~~~~~~~
$ cabal init
Package name [default "proglet"]? 
Package version [default "0.1"]? 
...
~~~~~~~~~~

It also asks questions about various other bits of package metadata. For
a package that you never intend to distribute to others, these fields can
be left blank.

One of the important questions is whether the package contains a library
or an executable. Libraries are collections of Haskell modules that can
be re-used by other Haskell libraries and programs, while executables
are standalone programs.

~~~~~~~~~~
What does the package build:
   1) Library
   2) Executable
Your choice?
~~~~~~~~~~

For the moment these are the only choices. For more complex packages
(e.g. a library and multiple executables or test suites) the `.cabal`
file can be edited afterwards.

Finally, `cabal init` creates the initial `proglet.cabal` and `Setup.hs`
files, and depending on your choice of license, a `LICENSE` file as well.

~~~~~~~~~~
Generating LICENSE...
Generating Setup.hs...
Generating proglet.cabal...

You may want to edit the .cabal file and add a Description field.
~~~~~~~~~~

As this stage the `proglet.cabal` is not quite complete and before you
are able to build the package you will need to edit the file and add
some build information about the library or executable.

### Editing the .cabal file ###

Load up the `.cabal` file in a text editor. The first part of the
`.cabal` file has the package metadata and towards the end of the file
you will find the `executable` or `library` section.

You will see that the fields that have yet to be filled in are commented
out. Cabal files use "`--`" Haskell-style comment syntax. (Note that
comments are only allowed on lines on their own. Trailing comments on
other lines are not allowed because they could be confused with program
options.)

If you selected earlier to create a library package then your `.cabal`
file will have a section that looks like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
library
  exposed-modules:     Proglet
  -- other-modules:
  -- build-depends:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, if you selected an executable then there will be a
section like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
executable proglet
  -- main-is:
  -- other-modules:
  -- build-depends:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build information fields listed (but commented out) are just the few
most important and common fields. There are many others that are covered
later in this chapter.

Most of the build information fields are the same between libraries and
executables. The difference is that libraries have a number of "exposed"
modules that make up the public interface of the library, while
executables have a file containing a `Main` module.

The name of a library always matches the name of the package, so it is
not specified in the library section. Executables often follow the name
of the package too, but this is not required and the name is given
explicitly.

### Modules included in the package ###

For a library, `cabal init` looks in the project directory for files
that look like Haskell modules and adds all the modules to the
`exposed-modules` field. For modules that do not form part of your
package's public interface, you can move those modules to the
`other-modules` field. Either way, all modules in the library need to be
listed.

For an executable, `cabal init` does not try to guess which file
contains your program's `Main` module. You will need to fill in the
`main-is` field with the file name of your program's `Main` module
(including `.hs` or `.lhs` extension). Other modules included in the
executable should be listed in the `other-modules` field.

### Modules imported from other packages ###

While your library or executable may include a number of modules, it
almost certainly also imports a number of external modules from the
standard libraries or other pre-packaged libraries. (These other
libraries are of course just Cabal packages that contain a library.)

You have to list all of the library packages that your library or
executable imports modules from. Or to put it another way: you have to
list all the other packages that your package depends on.

For example, suppose the example `Proglet` module imports the module
`Data.Map`. The `Data.Map` module comes from the `containers` package,
so we must list it:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
library
  exposed-modules:     Proglet
  other-modules:
  build-depends:       containers, base == 4.*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition, almost every package also depends on the `base` library
package because it exports the standard `Prelude` module plus other
basic modules like `Data.List`.

You will notice that we have listed `base == 4.*`. This gives a
constraint on the version of the base package that our package will work
with. The most common kinds of constraints are:

 * `pkgname >= n`
 * `pkgname >= n && < m`
 * `pkgname == n.*`

The last is just shorthand, for example `base == 4.*` means exactly the
same thing as `base >= 4 && < 5`.

### Building the package ###

For simple packages that's it! We can now try configuring and building
the package:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cabal configure
cabal build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming those two steps worked then you can also install the package:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cabal install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For libraries this makes them available for use in GHCi or to be used by
other packages. For executables it installs the program so that you can
run it (though you may first need to adjust your system's `$PATH`).

### Next steps ###

What we have covered so far should be enough for very simple packages
that you use on your own system.

The next few sections cover more details needed for more complex
packages and details needed for distributing packages to other people.

The previous chapter covers building and installing packages -- your own
packages or ones developed by other people.


# Package concepts #

Before diving into the details of writing packages it helps to
understand a bit about packages in the Haskell world and the particular
approach that Cabal takes.

### The point of packages ###

Packages are a mechanism for organising and distributing code. Packages
are particularly suited for "programming in the large", that is building
big systems by using and re-using code written by different people at
different times.

People organise code into packages based on functionality and
dependencies. Social factors are also important: most packages have a
single author, or a relatively small team of authors.

Packages are also used for distribution: the idea is that a package can
be created in one place and be moved to a different computer and be
usable in that different environment. There are a surprising number of
details that have to be got right for this to work, and a good package
system helps to simply this process and make it reliable.

Packages come in two main flavours: libraries of reusable code, and
complete programs. Libraries present a code interface, an API, while
programs can be run directly. In the Haskell world, library packages
expose a set of Haskell modules as their public interface. Cabal
packages can contain a library or executables or both.

Some programming languages have packages as a builtin language concept.
For example in Java, a package provides a local namespace for types and
other definitions. In the Haskell world, packages are not a part of the
language itself. Haskell programs consist of a number of modules, and
packages just provide a way to partition the modules into sets of
related functionality. Thus the choice of module names in Haskell is
still important, even when using packages.

### Package names and versions ###

All packages have a name, e.g. "HUnit". Package names are assumed to be
unique. Cabal package names can use letters, numbers and hyphens, but
not spaces. The namespace for Cabal packages is flat, not hierarchical.

Packages also have a version, e.g "1.1". This matches the typical way in
which packages are developed. Strictly speaking, each version of a
package is independent, but usually they are very similar. Cabal package
versions follow the conventional numeric style, consisting of a sequence
of digits such as "1.0.1" or "2.0". There are a range of common
conventions for "versioning" packages, that is giving some meaning to
the version number in terms of changes in the package. Section [TODO]
has some tips on package versioning.

The combination of package name and version is called the _package ID_
and is written with a hyphen to separate the name and version, e.g.
"HUnit-1.1". 

For Cabal packages, the combination of the package name and version
_uniquely_ identifies each package. Or to put it another way: two
packages with the same name and version are considered to _be_ the same.

Strictly speaking, the package ID only identifies each Cabal _source_
package; the same Cabal source package can be configured and built in
different ways. There is a separate installed package ID that uniquely
identifies each installed package instance. Most of the time however,
users need not be aware of this detail.

### Kinds of package: Cabal vs GHC vs system ###

It can be slightly confusing at first because there are various
different notions of package floating around. Fortunately the details
are not very complicated.

Cabal packages
:   Cabal packages are really source packages. That is they contain
    Haskell (and sometimes C) source code.
    
    Cabal packages can be compiled to produce GHC packages. They can
    also be translated into operating system packages.

GHC packages
:   This is GHC's view on packages. GHC only cares about library
    packages, not executables. Library packages have to be registered
    with GHC for them to be available in GHCi or to be used when
    compiling other programs or packages.
    
    The low-level tool `ghc-pkg` is used to register GHC packages and to
    get information on what packages are currently registered.
    
    You never need to make GHC packages manually. When you build and
    install a Cabal package containing a library then it gets registered
    with GHC automatically.
    
    Haskell implementations other than GHC have essentially the same
    concept of registered packages. For the most part, Cabal hides the
    slight differences.

Operating system packages
:   On operating systems like Linux and Mac OS X, the system has a
    specific notion of a package and there are tools for installing and
    managing packages.
    
    The Cabal package format is designed to allow Cabal packages to be
    translated, mostly-automatically, into operating system packages.
    They are usually translated 1:1, that is a single Cabal package
    becomes a single system package.
    
    It is also possible to make Windows installers from Cabal packages,
    though this is typically done for a program together with all of its
    library dependencies, rather than packaging each library separately.


### Unit of distribution ###

The Cabal package is the unit of distribution. What this means is that
each Cabal package can be distributed on its own in source or binary
form. Of course there may dependencies between packages, but there is
usually a degree of flexibility in which versions of packages can work
together so distributing them independently makes sense.

It is perhaps easiest to see what being ``the unit of distribution''
means by contrast to an alternative approach. Many projects are made up
of several interdependent packages and during development these might
all be kept under one common directory tree and be built and tested
together. When it comes to distribution however, rather than
distributing them all together in a single tarball, it is required that
they each be distributed independently in their own tarballs.

Cabal's approach is to say that if you can specify a dependency on a
package then that package should be able to be distributed
independently. Or to put it the other way round, if you want to
distribute it as a single unit, then it should be a single package.


### Explicit dependencies and automatic package management ###

Cabal takes the approach that all packages dependencies are specified
explicitly and specified in a declarative way. The point is to enable
automatic package management. This means tools like `cabal` can resolve
dependencies and install a package plus all of its dependencies
automatically. Alternatively, it is possible to mechanically (or mostly
mechanically) translate Cabal packages into system packages and let the
system package managager install dependencies automatically.

It is important to track dependencies accurately so that packages can
reliably be moved from one system to another system and still be able to
build it there. Cabal is therefore relatively strict about specifying
dependencies. For example Cabal's default build system will not even let
code build if it tries to import a module from a package that isn't
listed in the `.cabal` file, even if that package is actually installed.
This helps to ensure that there are no "untracked dependencies" that
could cause the code to fail to build on some other system.

The explicit dependency approach is in contrast to the traditional
"./configure" approach where instead of specifying dependencies
declarativly, the `./configure` script checks if the dependencies are
present on the system. Some manual work is required to transform a
`./configure` based package into a Linux distribution package (or
similar). This conversion work is usually done by people other than the
package author(s). The practical effect of this is that only the most
popular packages will benefit from automatic package managment. Instead,
Cabal forces the original author to specify the dependencies but the
advantage is that every package can benefit from automatic package
managment.

The "./configure" approach tends to encourage packages that adapt
themselves to the environment in which they are built, for example by
disabling optional features so that they can continue to work when a
particular dependency is not available. This approach makes sense in a
world where installing additional dependencies is a tiresome manual
process and so minimising dependencies is important. The automatic
package managment view is that packages should just declare what they
need and the package manager will take responsibility for ensuring that
all the dependencies are installed.

Sometimes of course optional features and optional dependencies do make
sense. Cabal packages can have optional features and varying
dependencies. These conditional dependencies are still specified in a
declarative way however and remain compatible with automatic package
management. The need to remain compatible with automatic package
management means that Cabal's conditional dependencies system is a bit
less flexible than with the "./configure" approach.

### Portability ###

One of the purposes of Cabal is to make it easier to build packages on
different platforms (operating systems and CPU architectures), with
different compiler versions and indeed even with different Haskell
implementations. (Yes, there are Haskell implementations other than
GHC!)

Cabal provides abstractions of features present in different Haskell
implementations and wherever possible it is best to take advantage of
these to increase portability. Where necessary however it is possible to
use specific features of specific implementations.

For example a package author can list in the package's `.cabal` what
language extensions the code uses. This allows Cabal to figure out if
the language extension is supported by the Haskell implementation that
the user picks. Additionally, certain language extensions such as
Template Haskell require special handling from the build system and by
listing the extension it provides the build system with enough
information to do the right thing.

Another similar example is linking with foreign libraries. Rather than
specifying GHC flags directly, the package author can list the libraries
that are needed and the build system will take care of using the right
flags for the compiler. Additionally this makes it easier for tools to
discover what system C libraries a package needs, which is useful for
tracking dependencies on system libraries (e.g. when translating into
linux distro packages).

In fact both of these examples fall into the category of explicitly
specifying dependencies. Not all dependencies are other Cabal packages.
Foreign libraries are clearly another kind of dependency. It's also
possible to think of language extensions as dependencies: the package
depends on a Haskell implementation that supports all those extensions.

Where compiler-specific options are needed however, there is an "escape
hatch" available. The developer can specify implementation-specific
options and more generally there is a configuration mechanism to
customise many aspects of how a package is built depending on the
Haskell implementation, the operating system, computer architecture and
user-specified configuration flags.


# Developing packages #

The Cabal package is the unit of distribution. When installed, its
purpose is to make available:

  * One or more Haskell programs.

  * At most one library, exposing a number of Haskell modules.

However having both a library and executables in a package does not work
very well; if the executables depend on the library, they must
explicitly list all the modules they directly or indirectly import from
that library.  Fortunately, starting with Cabal 1.8.0.4, executables can
also declare the package that they are in as a dependency, and Cabal
will treat them as if they were in another package that dependended on
the library.

Internally, the package may consist of much more than a bunch of Haskell
modules: it may also have C source code and header files, source code
meant for preprocessing, documentation, test cases, auxiliary tools etc.

A package is identified by a globally-unique _package name_, which
consists of one or more alphanumeric words separated by hyphens.  To
avoid ambiguity, each of these words should contain at least one letter.
Chaos will result if two distinct packages with the same name are
installed on the same system. A particular version of the package is
distinguished by a _version number_, consisting of a sequence of one or
more integers separated by dots.  These can be combined to form a single
text string called the _package ID_, using a hyphen to separate the name
from the version, e.g. "`HUnit-1.1`".

Note: Packages are not part of the Haskell language; they simply
populate the hierarchical space of module names. In GHC 6.6 and later a
program may contain multiple modules with the same name if they come
from separate packages; in all other current Haskell systems packages
may not overlap in the modules they provide, including hidden modules.


## Creating a package ##

Suppose you have a directory hierarchy containing the source files that
make up your package.  You will need to add two more files to the root
directory of the package:

_package_`.cabal`

:   a Unicode UTF-8 text file containing a package description.
    For details of the syntax of this file, see the [section on package
    descriptions](#package-descriptions).

`Setup.hs`

:   a single-module Haskell program to perform various setup tasks (with
    the interface described in the section on [building and installing
    packages](#building-and-installing-a-package)). This module should
    import only modules that will be present in all Haskell
    implementations, including modules of the Cabal library.  In most
    cases it will be trivial, calling on the Cabal library to do most of
    the work.

Once you have these, you can create a source bundle of this directory
for distribution. Building of the package is discussed in the section on
[building and installing packages](#building-and-installing-a-package).

One of the purposes of Cabal is to make it easier to build a package
with different Haskell implementations. So it provides abstractions of
features present in different Haskell implementations and wherever
possible it is best to take advantage of these to increase portability.
Where necessary however it is possible to use specific features of
specific implementations. For example one of the pieces of information a
package author can put in the package's `.cabal` file is what language
extensions the code uses. This is far preferable to specifying flags for
a specific compiler as it allows Cabal to pick the right flags for the
Haskell implementation that the user picks. It also allows Cabal to
figure out if the language extension is even supported by the Haskell
implementation that the user picks. Where compiler-specific options are
needed however, there is an "escape hatch" available. The developer can
specify implementation-specific options and more generally there is a
configuration mechanism to customise many aspects of how a package is
built depending on the Haskell implementation, the Operating system,
computer architecture and user-specified configuration flags.

required (directly or indirectly) by an executable must be listed again.

The trivial setup script used in these examples uses the _simple build
infrastructure_ provided by the Cabal library (see
[Distribution.Simple][dist-simple]). The simplicity lies in its
interface rather that its implementation. It automatically handles
preprocessing with standard preprocessors, and builds packages for all
the Haskell implementations (except nhc98, for now).

The simple build infrastructure can also handle packages where building
is governed by system-dependent parameters, if you specify a little more
(see the section on [system-dependent
parameters](#system-dependent-parameters)). A few packages require [more
elaborate solutions](#complex-packages).

## Package descriptions ##

The package description file must have a name ending in "`.cabal`".  It
must be a Unicode text file encoded using valid UTF-8. There must be
exactly one such file in the directory.  The first part of the name is
usually the package name, and some of the tools that operate on Cabal
packages require this.

In the package description file, lines whose first non-whitespace characters
are "`--`" are treated as comments and ignored.

This file should contain of a number global property descriptions and
several sections.

* The [global properties](#package-properties) describe the package as a
  whole, such as name, license, author, etc.

* Optionally, a number of _configuration flags_ can be declared.  These
  can be used to enable or disable certain features of a package. (see
  the section on [configurations](#configurations)).

* The (optional) library section specifies the [library
  properties](#library) and relevant [build
  information](#build-information).

* Following is an arbitrary number of executable sections
  which describe an [executable program](#executable) and relevant
  [build information](#build-information).

Each section consists of a number of property descriptions
in the form of field/value pairs, with a syntax roughly like mail
message headers.

* Case is not significant in field names, but is significant in field
  values.

* To continue a field value, indent the next line relative to the field
  name.

* Field names may be indented, but all field values in the same section
  must use the same indentation.

* Tabs are *not* allowed as indentation characters due to a missing
  standard interpretation of tab width.

* To get a blank line in a field value, use an indented "`.`"

The syntax of the value depends on the field.  Field types include:

_token_, _filename_, _directory_
:   Either a sequence of one or more non-space non-comma characters, or
    a quoted string in Haskell 98 lexical syntax. Unless otherwise
    stated, relative filenames and directories are interpreted from the
    package root directory.

_freeform_, _URL_, _address_
:   An arbitrary, uninterpreted string.

_identifier_
:   A letter followed by zero or more alphanumerics or underscores.

_compiler_
:   A compiler flavor (one of: `GHC`, `NHC`, `YHC`, `Hugs`, `HBC`,
    `Helium`, `JHC`, or `LHC`) followed by a version range.  For
    example, `GHC ==6.10.3`, or `LHC >=0.6 && <0.8`.

### Modules and preprocessors ###

Haskell module names listed in the `exposed-modules` and `other-modules`
fields may correspond to Haskell source files, i.e. with names ending in
"`.hs`" or "`.lhs`", or to inputs for various Haskell preprocessors. The
simple build infrastructure understands the extensions:

* `.gc` ([greencard][])
* `.chs` ([c2hs][])
* `.hsc` (`hsc2hs`)
* `.y` and `.ly` ([happy][])
* `.x` ([alex][])
* `.cpphs` ([cpphs][])

When building, Cabal will automatically run the appropriate preprocessor
and compile the Haskell module it produces.

Some fields take lists of values, which are optionally separated by commas,
except for the `build-depends` field, where the commas are mandatory.

Some fields are marked as required.  All others are optional, and unless
otherwise specified have empty default values.

### Package properties ###

These fields may occur in the first top-level properties section and
describe the package as a whole:

`name:` _package-name_ (required)
:   The unique name of the [package](#packages), without the version
    number.

`version:` _numbers_ (required)
:   The package version number, usually consisting of a sequence of
    natural numbers separated by dots.

`cabal-version:`  _>= x.y_
:   The version of the Cabal specification that this package description uses.
    The Cabal specification does slowly evolve, intoducing new features and
    occasionally changing the meaning of existing features. By specifying
    which version of the spec you are using it enables programs which process
    the package description to know what syntax to expect and what each part
    means.

    For historical reasons this is always expressed using _>=_ version range
    syntax. No other kinds of version range make sense, in particular upper
    bounds do not make sense. In future this field will specify just a version
    number, rather than a version range.

    The version number you specify will affect both compatability and
    behaviour. Most tools (including the Cabal libray and cabal program)
    understand a range of versions of the Cabal specification. Older tools
    will of course only work with older versions of the Cabal specification.
    Most of the time, tools that are too old will recognise this fact and
    produce a suitable error message.

    As for behaviour, new versions of the Cabal spec can change the meaning
    of existing syntax. This means if you want to take advantage of the new
    meaning or behaviour then you must specify the newer Cabal version.
    Tools are expected to use the meaning and behaviour appropriate to the
    version given in the package description.

    In particular, the syntax of package descriptions changed significantly
    with Cabal version 1.2 and the `cabal-version` field is now required.
    Files written in the old syntax are still recognized, so if you require
    compatability with very old Cabal versions then you may write your package
    description file using the old syntax.  Please consult the user's guide of
    an older Cabal version for a description of that syntax.

`build-type:` _identifier_
:   The type of build used by this package. Build types are the
    constructors of the [BuildType][] type, defaulting to `Custom`. If
    this field is given a value other than `Custom`, some tools such as
    `cabal-install` will be able to build the package without using the
    setup script. So if you are just using the default `Setup.hs` then
    set the build type as `Simple`.

`license:` _identifier_ (default: `AllRightsReserved`)
:   The type of license under which this package is distributed.
    License names are the constants of the [License][dist-license] type.

`license-file:` _filename_
:   The name of a file containing the precise license for this package.
    It will be installed with the package.

`copyright:` _freeform_
:   The content of a copyright notice, typically the name of the holder
    of the copyright on the package and the year(s) from which copyright
    is claimed. For example: `Copyright: (c) 2006-2007 Joe Bloggs`

`author:` _freeform_
:   The original author of the package.

    Remember that `.cabal` files are Unicode, using the UTF-8 encoding.

`maintainer:` _address_
:   The current maintainer or maintainers of the package. This is an e-mail address to which users should send bug
    reports, feature requests and patches.

`stability:` _freeform_
:   The stability level of the package, e.g. `alpha`, `experimental`, `provisional`,
    `stable`.

`homepage:` _URL_
:   The package homepage.

`bug-reports:` _URL_
:   The URL where users should direct bug reports. This would normally be either:

    * A `mailto:` URL, eg for a person or a mailing list.

    * An `http:` (or `https:`) URL for an online bug tracking system.

    For example Cabal itself uses a web-based bug tracking system

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    bug-reports: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`package-url:` _URL_
:   The location of a source bundle for the package. The distribution
    should be a Cabal package.

`synopsis:` _freeform_
:   A very short description of the package, for use in a table of
    packages.  This is your headline, so keep it short (one line) but as
    informative as possible. Save space by not including the package
    name or saying it's written in Haskell.

`description:` _freeform_
:   Description of the package.  This may be several paragraphs, and
    should be aimed at a Haskell programmer who has never heard of your
    package before.

    For library packages, this field is used as prologue text by [`setup
    haddock`](#setup-haddock), and thus may contain the same markup as
    [haddock][] documentation comments.

`category:` _freeform_
:   A classification category for future use by the package catalogue [Hackage].  These
    categories have not yet been specified, but the upper levels of the
    module hierarchy make a good start.

`tested-with:` _compiler list_
:   A list of compilers and versions against which the package has been
    tested (or at least built).

`data-files:` _filename list_
:   A list of files to be installed for run-time use by the package.
    This is useful for packages that use a large amount of static data,
    such as tables of values  or code templates. Cabal provides a way to
    [find these files at
    run-time](#accessing-data-files-from-package-code).

    A limited form of `*` wildcards in file names, for example
    `data-files: images/*.png` matches all the `.png` files in the
    `images` directory.

    The limitation is that `*` wildcards are only allowed in place of
    the file name, not in the directory name or file extension.  In
    particular, wildcards do not include directories contents
    recursively. Furthermore, if a wildcard is used it must be used with
    an extension, so `data-files: data/*` is not allowed. When matching
    a wildcard plus extension, a file's full extension must match
    exactly, so `*.gz` matches `foo.gz` but not `foo.tar.gz`. A wildcard
    that does not match any files is an error.

    The reason for providing only a very limited form of wildcard is to
    concisely express the common case of a large number of related files
    of the same file type without making it too easy to accidentally
    include unwanted files.

`data-dir:` _directory_
:   The directory where Cabal looks for data files to install, relative
    to the source directory. By default, Cabal will look in the source
    directory itself.

`extra-source-files:` _filename list_
:   A list of additional files to be included in source distributions
    built with [`setup sdist`](#setup-sdist). As with `data-files` it
    can use a limited form of `*` wildcards in file names.

`extra-doc-files:` _filename list_
:   A list of additional files to be included in source distributions,
    and also copied to the html directory when Haddock documentation is
    generated. As with `data-files` it can use a limited form of `*`
    wildcards in file names.

`extra-tmp-files:` _filename list_
:   A list of additional files or directories to be removed by [`setup
    clean`](#setup-clean). These would typically be additional files
    created by additional hooks, such as the scheme described in the
    section on [system-dependent parameters](#system-dependent-parameters).

### Library ###

The library section should contain the following fields:

`exposed-modules:` _identifier list_ (required if this package contains a library)
:   A list of modules added by this package.

`exposed:` _boolean_ (default: `True`)
:   Some Haskell compilers (notably GHC) support the notion of packages
    being "exposed" or "hidden" which means the modules they provide can
    be easily imported without always having to specify which package
    they come from. However this only works effectively if the modules
    provided by all exposed packages do not overlap (otherwise a module
    import would be ambiguous).

    Almost all new libraries use hierarchical module names that do not
    clash, so it is very uncommon to have to use this field. However it
    may be necessary to set `exposed: False` for some old libraries that
    use a flat module namespace or where it is known that the exposed
    modules would clash with other common modules.

The library section may also contain build information fields (see the
section on [build information](#build-information)).

#### Opening an interpreter session ####

While developing a package, it is often useful to make its code available inside
an interpreter session. This can be done with the `repl` command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cabal repl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name comes from the acronym [REPL], which stands for
"read-eval-print-loop". By default `cabal repl` loads the first component in a
package. If the package contains several named components, the name can be given
as an argument to `repl`. The name can be also optionally prefixed with the
component's type for disambiguation purposes. Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cabal repl foo
cabal repl exe:foo
cabal repl test:bar
cabal repl bench:baz
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Executables ###

Executable sections (if present) describe executable programs contained
in the package and must have an argument after the section label, which
defines the name of the executable.  This is a freeform argument but may
not contain spaces.

The executable may be described using the following fields, as well as
build information fields (see the section on [build
information](#build-information)).

`main-is:` _filename_ (required)
:   The name of the `.hs` or `.lhs` file containing the `Main` module. Note that it is the
    `.hs` filename that must be listed, even if that file is generated
    using a preprocessor. The source file must be relative to one of the
    directories listed in `hs-source-dirs`.

#### Running executables ####

You can have Cabal build and run your executables by using the `run` command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cabal run EXECUTABLE [-- EXECUTABLE_FLAGS]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command will configure, build and run the executable `EXECUTABLE`. The
double dash separator is required to distinguish executable flags from `run`'s
own flags. If there is only one executable defined in the whole package, the
executable's name can be omitted. See the output of `cabal help run` for a list
of options you can pass to `cabal run`.


### Test suites ###

Test suite sections (if present) describe package test suites and must have an
argument after the section label, which defines the name of the test suite.
This is a freeform argument, but may not contain spaces.  It should be unique
among the names of the package's other test suites, the package's executables,
and the package itself.  Using test suite sections requires at least Cabal
version 1.9.2.

The test suite may be described using the following fields, as well as build
information fields (see the section on [build
information](#build-information)).

`type:` _interface_ (required)
:   The interface type and version of the test suite.  Cabal supports two test
    suite interfaces, called `exitcode-stdio-1.0` and `detailed-1.0`.  Each of
    these types may require or disallow other fields as described below.

Test suites using the `exitcode-stdio-1.0` interface are executables
that indicate test failure with a non-zero exit code when run; they may provide
human-readable log information through the standard output and error channels.
This interface is provided primarily for compatibility with existing test
suites; it is preferred that new test suites be written for the `detailed-1.0`
interface.  The `exitcode-stdio-1.0` type requires the `main-is` field.

`main-is:` _filename_ (required: `exitcode-stdio-1.0`, disallowed: `detailed-1.0`)
:   The name of the `.hs` or `.lhs` file containing the `Main` module. Note that it is the
    `.hs` filename that must be listed, even if that file is generated
    using a preprocessor. The source file must be relative to one of the
    directories listed in `hs-source-dirs`.  This field is analogous to the
    `main-is` field of an executable section.

Test suites using the `detailed-1.0` interface are modules exporting the symbol
`tests :: IO [Test]`.  The `Test` type is exported by the module
`Distribution.TestSuite` provided by Cabal.  For more details, see the example below.

The `detailed-1.0` interface allows Cabal and other test agents to inspect a
test suite's results case by case, producing detailed human- and
machine-readable log files.  The `detailed-1.0` interface requires the
`test-module` field.

`test-module:` _identifier_ (required: `detailed-1.0`, disallowed: `exitcode-stdio-1.0`)
:   The module exporting the `tests` symbol.

#### Example: Package using `exitcode-stdio-1.0` interface ####

The example package description and executable source file below demonstrate
the use of the `exitcode-stdio-1.0` interface.  For brevity, the example package
does not include a library or any normal executables, but a real package would
be required to have at least one library or executable.

foo.cabal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name:           foo
Version:        1.0
License:        BSD3
Cabal-Version:  >= 1.9.2
Build-Type:     Simple

Test-Suite test-foo
    type:       exitcode-stdio-1.0
    main-is:    test-foo.hs
    build-depends: base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

test-foo.hs:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
module Main where

import System.Exit (exitFailure)

main = do
    putStrLn "This test always fails!"
    exitFailure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Example: Package using `detailed-1.0` interface ####

The example package description and test module source file below demonstrate
the use of the `detailed-1.0` interface.  For brevity, the example package does
note include a library or any normal executables, but a real package would be
required to have at least one library or executable.  The test module below
also develops a simple implementation of the interface set by
`Distribution.TestSuite`, but in actual usage the implementation would be
provided by the library that provides the testing facility.

bar.cabal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name:           bar
Version:        1.0
License:        BSD3
Cabal-Version:  >= 1.9.2
Build-Type:     Simple

Test-Suite test-bar
    type:       detailed-1.0
    test-module: Bar
    build-depends: base, Cabal >= 1.9.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bar.hs:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
module Bar ( tests ) where

import Distribution.TestSuite

tests :: IO [Test]
tests = return [ Test succeeds, Test fails ]
  where
    succeeds = TestInstance
        { run = return $ Finished Pass
        , name = "succeeds"
        , tags = []
        , options = []
        , setOption = \_ _ -> Right succeeds
        }
    fails = TestInstance
        { run = return $ Finished $ Fail "Always fails!"
        , name = "fails"
        , tags = []
        , options = []
        , setOption = \_ _ -> Right fails
        }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Running test suites ####

You can have Cabal run your test suites using its built-in test
runner:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cabal configure --enable-tests
$ cabal build
$ cabal test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the output of `cabal help test` for a list of options you can pass
to `cabal test`.

### Benchmarks ###

Benchmark sections (if present) describe benchmarks contained in the package and
must have an argument after the section label, which defines the name of the
benchmark.  This is a freeform argument, but may not contain spaces.  It should
be unique among the names of the package's other benchmarks, the package's test
suites, the package's executables, and the package itself.  Using benchmark
sections requires at least Cabal version 1.9.2.

The benchmark may be described using the following fields, as well as build
information fields (see the section on [build information](#build-information)).

`type:` _interface_ (required)
:   The interface type and version of the benchmark.  At the moment Cabal only
    support one benchmark interface, called `exitcode-stdio-1.0`.

Benchmarks using the `exitcode-stdio-1.0` interface are executables that
indicate failure to run the benchmark with a non-zero exit code when run; they
may provide human-readable information through the standard output and error
channels.

`main-is:` _filename_ (required: `exitcode-stdio-1.0`)
:   The name of the `.hs` or `.lhs` file containing the `Main` module. Note that
    it is the `.hs` filename that must be listed, even if that file is generated
    using a preprocessor. The source file must be relative to one of the
    directories listed in `hs-source-dirs`.  This field is analogous to the
    `main-is` field of an executable section.

#### Example: Package using `exitcode-stdio-1.0` interface ####

The example package description and executable source file below demonstrate
the use of the `exitcode-stdio-1.0` interface.  For brevity, the example package
does not include a library or any normal executables, but a real package would
be required to have at least one library or executable.

foo.cabal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name:           foo
Version:        1.0
License:        BSD3
Cabal-Version:  >= 1.9.2
Build-Type:     Simple

Benchmark bench-foo
    type:       exitcode-stdio-1.0
    main-is:    bench-foo.hs
    build-depends: base, time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

bench-foo.hs:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}
module Main where

import Data.Time.Clock

fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

main = do
    start <- getCurrentTime
    let !r = fib 20
    end <- getCurrentTime
    putStrLn $ "fib 20 took " ++ show (diffUTCTime end start)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Running benchmarks ####

You can have Cabal run your benchmark using its built-in benchmark runner:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cabal configure --enable-benchmarks
$ cabal build
$ cabal bench
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the output of `cabal help bench` for a list of options you can
pass to `cabal bench`.

### Build information ###

The following fields may be optionally present in a library or
executable section, and give information for the building of the
corresponding library or executable.  See also the sections on
[system-dependent parameters](#system-dependent-parameters) and
[configurations](#configurations) for a way to supply system-dependent
values for these fields.

`build-depends:` _package list_
:   A list of packages needed to build this one. Each package can be
    annotated with a version constraint.

    Version constraints use the operators `==, >=, >, <, <=` and a
    version number. Multiple constraints can be combined using `&&` or
    `||`. If no version constraint is specified, any version is assumed
    to be acceptable. For example:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    library
      build-depends:
        base >= 2,
        foo >= 1.2 && < 1.3,
        bar
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Dependencies like `foo >= 1.2 && < 1.3` turn out to be very common
    because it is recommended practise for package versions to
    correspond to API versions. As of Cabal 1.6, there is a special
    syntax to support this use:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    build-depends: foo ==1.2.*
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    It is only syntactic sugar. It is exactly equivalent to `foo >= 1.2 && < 1.3`.

    Note: Prior to Cabal 1.8, build-depends specified in each section
    were global to all sections. This was unintentional, but some packages
    were written to depend on it, so if you need your build-depends to
    be local to each section, you must specify at least
    `Cabal-Version: >= 1.8` in your `.cabal` file.

`other-modules:` _identifier list_
:   A list of modules used by the component but not exposed to users.
    For a library component, these would be hidden modules of the
    library. For an executable, these would be auxiliary modules to be
    linked with the file named in the `main-is` field.

    Note: Every module in the package *must* be listed in one of
    `other-modules`, `exposed-modules` or `main-is` fields.

`hs-source-dirs:` _directory list_ (default: "`.`")
:   Root directories for the module hierarchy.

    For backwards compatibility, the old variant `hs-source-dir` is also
    recognized.

`extensions:` _identifier list_
:   A list of Haskell extensions used by every module. Extension names
    are the constructors of the [Extension][extension] type. These
    determine corresponding compiler options. In particular, `CPP` specifies that
    Haskell source files are to be preprocessed with a C preprocessor.

    Extensions used only by one module may be specified by placing a
    `LANGUAGE` pragma in the source file affected, e.g.:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    {-# LANGUAGE CPP, MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Note:  GHC versions prior to 6.6 do not support the `LANGUAGE` pragma.

`build-tools:` _program list_
:   A list of programs, possibly annotated with versions, needed to
    build this package, e.g. `c2hs >= 0.15, cpphs`.If no version
    constraint is specified, any version is assumed to be acceptable.

`buildable:` _boolean_ (default: `True`)
:   Is the component buildable? Like some of the other fields below,
    this field is more useful with the slightly more elaborate form of
    the simple build infrastructure described in the section on
    [system-dependent parameters](#system-dependent-parameters).

`ghc-options:` _token list_
:   Additional options for GHC. You can often achieve the same effect
    using the `extensions` field, which is preferred.

    Options required only by one module may be specified by placing an
    `OPTIONS_GHC` pragma in the source file affected.

`ghc-prof-options:` _token list_
:   Additional options for GHC when the package is built with profiling
    enabled.

`ghc-shared-options:` _token list_
:   Additional options for GHC when the package is built as shared library.

`hugs-options:` _token list_
:   Additional options for Hugs. You can often achieve the same effect
    using the `extensions` field, which is preferred.

    Options required only by one module may be specified by placing an
    `OPTIONS_HUGS` pragma in the source file affected.

`nhc98-options:` _token list_
:   Additional options for nhc98. You can often achieve the same effect
    using the `extensions` field, which is preferred.

    Options required only by one module may be specified by placing an
    `OPTIONS_NHC98` pragma in the source file affected.

`includes:` _filename list_
:   A list of header files to be included in any compilations via C.
    This field applies to both header files that are already installed
    on the system and to those coming with the package to be installed.
    These files typically contain function prototypes for foreign
    imports used by the package.

`install-includes:` _filename list_
:   A list of header files from this package to be installed into
    `$libdir/includes` when the package is installed. Files listed in
    `install-includes:` should be found in relative to the top of the
    source tree or relative to one of the directories listed in
    `include-dirs`.

    `install-includes` is typically used to name header files that
    contain prototypes for foreign imports used in Haskell code in this
    package, for which the C implementations are also provided with the
    package.  Note that to include them when compiling the package
    itself, they need to be listed in the `includes:` field as well.

`include-dirs:` _directory list_
:   A list of directories to search for header files, when preprocessing
    with `c2hs`, `hsc2hs`, `ffihugs`, `cpphs` or the C preprocessor, and
    also when compiling via C.

`c-sources:` _filename list_
:   A list of C source files to be compiled and linked with the Haskell files.

    If you use this field, you should also name the C files in `CFILES`
    pragmas in the Haskell source files that use them, e.g.: `{-# CFILES
    dir/file1.c dir/file2.c #-}` These are ignored by the compilers, but
    needed by Hugs.

`extra-libraries:` _token list_
:   A list of extra libraries to link with.

`extra-lib-dirs:` _directory list_
:   A list of directories to search for libraries.

`cc-options:` _token list_
:   Command-line arguments to be passed to the C compiler. Since the
    arguments are compiler-dependent, this field is more useful with the
    setup described in the section on [system-dependent
    parameters](#system-dependent-parameters).

`ld-options:` _token list_
:   Command-line arguments to be passed to the linker. Since the
    arguments are compiler-dependent, this field is more useful with the
    setup described in the section on [system-dependent
    parameters](#system-dependent-parameters)>.

`pkgconfig-depends:` _package list_
:   A list of [pkg-config][] packages, needed to build this package.
    They can be annotated with versions, e.g. `gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10, cairo
    >= 1.0`. If no version constraint is specified, any version is
    assumed to be acceptable. Cabal uses `pkg-config` to find if the
    packages are available on the system and to find the extra
    compilation and linker options needed to use the packages.

    If you need to bind to a C library that supports `pkg-config` (use
    `pkg-config --list-all` to find out if it is supported) then it is
    much preferable to use this field rather than hard code options into
    the other fields.

`frameworks:` _token list_
:   On Darwin/MacOS X, a list of frameworks to link to. See Apple's
    developer documentation for more details on frameworks.  This entry
    is ignored on all other platforms.

### Configurations ###

Library and executable sections may include conditional
blocks, which test for various system parameters and
configuration flags.  The flags mechanism is rather generic,
but most of the time a flag represents certain feature, that
can be switched on or off by the package user.
Here is an example package description file using
configurations:

#### Example: A package containing a library and executable programs ####

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name: Test1
Version: 0.0.1
Cabal-Version: >= 1.2
License: BSD3
Author:  Jane Doe
Synopsis: Test package to test configurations
Category: Example

Flag Debug
  Description: Enable debug support
  Default:     False

Flag WebFrontend
  Description: Include API for web frontend.
  -- Cabal checks if the configuration is possible, first
  -- with this flag set to True and if not it tries with False

Library
  Build-Depends:   base
  Exposed-Modules: Testing.Test1
  Extensions:      CPP

  if flag(debug)
    GHC-Options: -DDEBUG
    if !os(windows)
      CC-Options: "-DDEBUG"
    else
      CC-Options: "-DNDEBUG"

  if flag(webfrontend)
    Build-Depends: cgi > 0.42
    Other-Modules: Testing.WebStuff

Executable test1
  Main-is: T1.hs
  Other-Modules: Testing.Test1
  Build-Depends: base

  if flag(debug)
    CC-Options: "-DDEBUG"
    GHC-Options: -DDEBUG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Layout ####

Flags, conditionals, library and executable sections use layout to
indicate structure. This is very similar to the Haskell layout rule.
Entries in a section have to all be indented to the same level which
must be more than the section header. Tabs are not allowed to be used
for indentation.

As an alternative to using layout you can also use explicit braces `{}`.
In this case the indentation of entries in a section does not matter,
though different fields within a block must be on different lines. Here
is a bit of the above example again, using braces:

#### Example: Using explicit braces rather than indentation for layout ####

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name: Test1
Version: 0.0.1
Cabal-Version: >= 1.2
License: BSD3
Author:  Jane Doe
Synopsis: Test package to test configurations
Category: Example

Flag Debug {
  Description: Enable debug support
  Default:     False
}

Library {
  Build-Depends:   base
  Exposed-Modules: Testing.Test1
  Extensions:      CPP
  if flag(debug) {
    GHC-Options: -DDEBUG
    if !os(windows) {
      CC-Options: "-DDEBUG"
    } else {
      CC-Options: "-DNDEBUG"
    }
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Configuration Flags ####

A flag section takes the flag name as an argument and may contain the
following fields.

`description:` _freeform_
:   The description of this flag.

`default:` _boolean_ (default: `True`)
:   The default value of this flag.

    Note that this value may be [overridden in several
    ways](#controlling-flag-assignments"). The rationale for having
    flags default to True is that users usually want new features as
    soon as they are available. Flags representing features that are not
    (yet) recommended for most users (such as experimental features or
    debugging support) should therefore explicitly override the default
    to False.

`manual:` _boolean_ (default: `False`)
:   By default, Cabal will first try to satisfy dependencies with the
    default flag value and then, if that is not possible, with the
    negated value. However, if the flag is manual, then the default
    value (which can be overridden by commandline flags) will be used.

#### Conditional Blocks ####

Conditional blocks may appear anywhere inside a library or executable
section.  They have to follow rather strict formatting rules.
Conditional blocks must always be of the shape

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  `if `_condition_
       _property-descriptions-or-conditionals*_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  `if `_condition_
       _property-descriptions-or-conditionals*_
  `else`
       _property-descriptions-or-conditionals*_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the `if` and the condition have to be all on the same line.

#### Conditions ####

Conditions can be formed using boolean tests and the boolean operators
`||` (disjunction / logical "or"), `&&` (conjunction / logical "and"),
or `!` (negation / logical "not").  The unary `!` takes highest
precedence, `||` takes lowest.  Precedence levels may be overridden
through the use of parentheses. For example, `os(darwin) && !arch(i386)
|| os(freebsd)` is equivalent to `(os(darwin) && !(arch(i386))) ||
os(freebsd)`.

The following tests are currently supported.

`os(`_name_`)`
:   Tests if the current operating system is _name_. The argument is
    tested against `System.Info.os` on the target system. There is
    unfortunately some disagreement between Haskell implementations
    about the standard values of `System.Info.os`. Cabal canonicalises
    it so that in particular `os(windows)` works on all implementations.
    If the canonicalised os names match, this test evaluates to true,
    otherwise false. The match is case-insensitive.

`arch(`_name_`)`
:   Tests if the current architecture is _name_.  The argument is
    matched against `System.Info.arch` on the target system. If the arch
    names match, this test evaluates to true, otherwise false. The match
    is case-insensitive.

`impl(`_compiler_`)`
:   Tests for the configured Haskell implementation. An optional version
    constraint may be specified (for example `impl(ghc >= 6.6.1)`). If
    the configured implementation is of the right type and matches the
    version constraint, then this evaluates to true, otherwise false.
    The match is case-insensitive.

`flag(`_name_`)`
:   Evaluates to the current assignment of the flag of the given name.
    Flag names are case insensitive. Testing for flags that have not
    been introduced with a flag section is an error.

`true`
:   Constant value true.

`false`
:   Constant value false.

#### Resolution of Conditions and Flags ####

If a package descriptions specifies configuration flags the package user
can [control these in several ways](#controlling-flag-assignments). If
the user does not fix the value of a flag, Cabal will try to find a flag
assignment in the following way.

  * For each flag specified, it will assign its default value, evaluate
    all conditions with this flag assignment, and check if all
    dependencies can be satisfied.  If this check succeeded, the package
    will be configured with those flag assignments.

  * If dependencies were missing, the last flag (as by the order in
    which the flags were introduced in the package description) is tried
    with its alternative value and so on.  This continues until either
    an assignment is found where all dependencies can be satisfied, or
    all possible flag assignments have been tried.

To put it another way, Cabal does a complete backtracking search to find
a satisfiable package configuration. It is only the dependencies
specified in the `build-depends` field in conditional blocks that
determine if a particular flag assignment is satisfiable (`build-tools`
are not considered). The order of the declaration and the default value
of the flags determines the search order. Flags overridden on the
command line fix the assignment of that flag, so no backtracking will be
tried for that flag.

If no suitable flag assignment could be found, the configuration phase
will fail and a list of missing dependencies will be printed.  Note that
this resolution process is exponential in the worst case (i.e., in the
case where dependencies cannot be satisfied).  There are some
optimizations applied internally, but the overall complexity remains
unchanged.

### Meaning of field values when using conditionals ###

During the configuration phase, a flag assignment is chosen, all
conditionals are evaluated, and the package description is combined into
a flat package descriptions. If the same field both inside a conditional
and outside then they are combined using the following rules.


  * Boolean fields are combined using conjunction (logical "and").

  * List fields are combined by appending the inner items to the outer
    items, for example

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Extensions: CPP
    if impl(ghc) || impl(hugs)
      Extensions: MultiParamTypeClasses
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    when compiled using Hugs or GHC will be combined to

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Extensions: CPP, MultiParamTypeClasses
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Similarly, if two conditional sections appear at the same nesting
    level, properties specified in the latter will come after properties
    specified in the former.

  * All other fields must not be specified in ambiguous ways. For
    example

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Main-is: Main.hs
    if flag(useothermain)
      Main-is: OtherMain.hs
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    will lead to an error.  Instead use

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    if flag(useothermain)
      Main-is: OtherMain.hs
    else
      Main-is: Main.hs
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Source Repositories ###

It is often useful to be able to specify a source revision control
repository for a package. Cabal lets you specifying this information in
a relatively structured form which enables other tools to interpret and
make effective use of the information. For example the information
should be sufficient for an automatic tool to checkout the sources.

Cabal supports specifying different information for various common
source control systems. Obviously not all automated tools will support
all source control systems.

Cabal supports specifying repositories for different use cases. By
declaring which case we mean automated tools can be more useful. There
are currently two kinds defined:

 *  The `head` kind refers to the latest development branch of the
    package. This may be used for example to track activity of a project
    or as an indication to outside developers what sources to get for
    making new contributions.

 *  The `this` kind refers to the branch and tag of a repository that
    contains the sources for this version or release of a package. For most
    source control systems this involves specifying a tag, id or hash of
    some form and perhaps a branch. The purpose is to be able to
    reconstruct the sources corresponding to a particular package
    version. This might be used to indicate what sources to get if
    someone needs to fix a bug in an older branch that is no longer an
    active head branch.

You can specify one kind or the other or both. As an example here are
the repositories for the Cabal library. Note that the `this` kind of
repo specifies a tag.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
source-repository head
  type:     darcs
  location: http://darcs.haskell.org/cabal/

source-repository this
  type:     darcs
  location: http://darcs.haskell.org/cabal-branches/cabal-1.6/
  tag:      1.6.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exact fields are as follows:

`type:` _token_
:   The name of the source control system used for this repository. The
    currently recognised types are:

    * `darcs`
    * `git`
    * `svn`
    * `cvs`
    * `mercurial` (or alias `hg`)
    * `bazaar` (or alias `bzr`)
    * `arch`
    * `monotone`

    This field is required.

`location:` _URL_
:   The location of the repository. The exact form of this field depends
    on the repository type. For example:

    * for darcs: `http://code.haskell.org/foo/`
    * for git: `git://github.com/foo/bar.git`
    * for CVS: `anoncvs@cvs.foo.org:/cvs`

    This field is required.

`module:` _token_
:   CVS requires a named module, as each CVS server can host multiple
    named repositories.

    This field is required for the CVS repo type and should not be used
    otherwise.

`branch:` _token_
:   Many source control systems support the notion of a branch, as a
    distinct concept from having repositories in separate locations. For
    example CVS, SVN and git use branches while for darcs uses different
    locations for different branches. If you need to specify a branch to
    identify a your repository then specify it in this field.

    This field is optional.

`tag:` _token_
:   A tag identifies a particular state of a source repository. The tag
    can be used with a `this` repo kind to identify the state of a repo
    corresponding to a particular package version or release. The exact
    form of the tag depends on the repository type.

    This field is required for the `this` repo kind.

`subdir:` _directory_
:   Some projects put the sources for multiple packages under a single
    source repository. This field lets you specify the relative path
    from the root of the repository to the top directory for the
    package, ie the directory containing the package's `.cabal` file.

    This field is optional. It default to empty which corresponds to the
    root directory of the repository.

### Downloading a package's source ###

The `cabal get` command allows to access a package's source code - either by
unpacking a tarball downloaded from Hackage (the default) or by checking out a
working copy from the package's source repository.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cabal get [FLAGS] PACKAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `get` command supports the following options:

`-d --destdir` _PATH_
:   Where to place the package source, defaults to (a subdirectory of) the
    current directory.

`-s --source-repository` _[head|this|...]_
:   Fork the package's source repository using the appropriate version control
    system. The optional argument allows to choose a specific repo kind.


## Accessing data files from package code ##

The placement on the target system of files listed in the `data-files`
field varies between systems, and in some cases one can even move
packages around after installation (see [prefix
independence](#prefix-independence)).  To enable packages to find these
files in a portable way, Cabal generates a module called
`Paths_`_pkgname_ (with any hyphens in _pkgname_ replaced by
underscores) during building, so that it may be imported by modules of
the package.  This module defines a function

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
getDataFileName :: FilePath -> IO FilePath
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the argument is a filename listed in the `data-files` field, the
result is the name of the corresponding file on the system on which the
program is running.

Note: If you decide to import the `Paths_`_pkgname_ module then it
*must* be listed in the `other-modules` field just like any other module
in your package.

The `Paths_`_pkgname_ module is not platform independent so it does not
get included in the source tarballs generated by `sdist`.

### Accessing the package version ###

The aforementioned auto generated `Paths_`_pkgname_ module also
exports the constant `version ::` [Version][data-version] which is
defined as the version of your package as specified in the `version`
field.

## System-dependent parameters ##

For some packages, especially those interfacing with C libraries,
implementation details and the build procedure depend on the build
environment.  A variant of the simple build infrastructure (the
`build-type` `Configure`) handles many such situations using a slightly
longer `Setup.hs`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import Distribution.Simple
main = defaultMainWithHooks autoconfUserHooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most packages, however, would probably do better with
[configurations](#configurations).

This program differs from `defaultMain` in two ways:

* The package root directory must contain a shell script called
  `configure`. The configure step will run the script. This `configure`
  script may be produced by [autoconf][] or may be hand-written. The
  `configure` script typically discovers information about the system
  and records it for later steps, e.g. by generating system-dependent
  header files for inclusion in C source files and preprocessed Haskell
  source files. (Clearly this won't work for Windows without MSYS or
  Cygwin: other ideas are needed.)

* If the package root directory contains a file called
  _package_`.buildinfo` after the configuration step, subsequent steps
  will read it to obtain additional settings for [build
  information](#build-information) fields,to be merged with the ones
  given in the `.cabal` file. In particular, this file may be generated
  by the `configure` script mentioned above, allowing these settings to
  vary depending on the build environment.

  The build information file should have the following structure:

  > _buildinfo_
  >
  > `executable:` _name_
  > _buildinfo_
  >
  > `executable:` _name_
  > _buildinfo_
  > ...

  where each _buildinfo_ consists of settings of fields listed in the
  section on [build information](#build-information). The first one (if
  present) relates to the library, while each of the others relate to
  the named executable.  (The names must match the package description,
  but you don't have to have entries for all of them.)

Neither of these files is required.  If they are absent, this setup
script is equivalent to `defaultMain`.

#### Example: Using autoconf ####

This example is for people familiar with the [autoconf][] tools.

In the X11 package, the file `configure.ac` contains:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AC_INIT([Haskell X11 package], [1.1], [libraries@haskell.org], [X11])

# Safety check: Ensure that we are in the correct source directory.
AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([X11.cabal])

# Header file to place defines in
AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([include/HsX11Config.h])

# Check for X11 include paths and libraries
AC_PATH_XTRA
AC_TRY_CPP([#include <X11/Xlib.h>],,[no_x=yes])

# Build the package if we found X11 stuff
if test "$no_x" = yes
then BUILD_PACKAGE_BOOL=False
else BUILD_PACKAGE_BOOL=True
fi
AC_SUBST([BUILD_PACKAGE_BOOL])

AC_CONFIG_FILES([X11.buildinfo])
AC_OUTPUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then the setup script will run the `configure` script, which checks for
the presence of the X11 libraries and substitutes for variables in the
file `X11.buildinfo.in`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
buildable: @BUILD_PACKAGE_BOOL@
cc-options: @X_CFLAGS@
ld-options: @X_LIBS@
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This generates a file `X11.buildinfo` supplying the parameters needed by
later stages:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
buildable: True
cc-options:  -I/usr/X11R6/include
ld-options:  -L/usr/X11R6/lib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `configure` script also generates a header file `include/HsX11Config.h`
containing C preprocessor defines recording the results of various tests.  This
file may be included by C source files and preprocessed Haskell source files in
the package.

Note: Packages using these features will also need to list additional files such
as `configure`, templates for `.buildinfo` files, files named only in
`.buildinfo` files, header files and so on in the `extra-source-files` field to
ensure that they are included in source distributions.  They should also list
files and directories generated by `configure` in the `extra-tmp-files` field to
ensure that they are removed by `setup clean`.

Quite often the files generated by `configure` need to be listed somewhere in
the package description (for example, in the `install-includes` field). However,
we usually don't want generated files to be included in the source tarball. The
solution is again provided by the `.buildinfo` file. In the above example, the
following line should be added to `X11.buildinfo`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
install-includes: HsX11Config.h
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this way, the generated `HsX11Config.h` file won't be included in the source
tarball in addition to `HsX11Config.h.in`, but it will be copied to the right
location during the install process. Packages that use custom `Setup.hs` scripts
can update the necessary fields programmatically instead of using the
`.buildinfo` file.


## Conditional compilation ##

Sometimes you want to write code that works with more than one version
of a dependency.  You can specify a range of versions for the depenency
in the `build-depends`, but how do you then write the code that can use
different versions of the API?

Haskell lets you preprocess your code using the C preprocessor (either
the real C preprocessor, or `cpphs`).  To enable this, add `extensions:
CPP` to your package description.  When using CPP, Cabal provides some
pre-defined macros to let you test the version of dependent packages;
for example, suppose your package works with either version 3 or version
4 of the `base` package, you could select the available version in your
Haskell modules like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#if MIN_VERSION_base(4,0,0)
... code that works with base-4 ...
#else
... code that works with base-3 ...
#endif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, Cabal supplies a macro `MIN_VERSION_`_`package`_`_(A,B,C)`
for each package depended on via `build-depends`. This macro is true if
the actual version of the package in use is greater than or equal to
`A.B.C` (using the conventional ordering on version numbers, which is
lexicographic on the sequence, but numeric on each component, so for
example 1.2.0 is greater than 1.0.3).

Since version 1.20, there is also the `MIN_TOOL_VERSION_`_`tool`_ family of
macros for conditioning on the version of build tools used to build the program
(e.g. `hsc2hs`).

Cabal places the definitions of these macros into an
automatically-generated header file, which is included when
preprocessing Haskell source code by passing options to the C
preprocessor.

Cabal also allows to detect when the source code is being used for generating
documentation. The `__HADDOCK_VERSION__` macro is defined only when compiling
via [haddock][] instead of a normal Haskell compiler. The value of the
`__HADDOCK_VERSION__` macro is defined as `A*1000 + B*10 + C`, where `A.B.C` is
the Haddock version. This can be useful for working around bugs in Haddock or
generating prettier documentation in some special cases.

## More complex packages ##

For packages that don't fit the simple schemes described above, you have
a few options:

  * You can customize the simple build infrastructure using _hooks_.
    These allow you to perform additional actions before and after each
    command is run, and also to specify additional preprocessors.  See
    `UserHooks` in [Distribution.Simple][dist-simple] for the details,
    but note that this interface is experimental, and likely to change
    in future releases.

  * You could delegate all the work to `make`, though this is unlikely
    to be very portable. Cabal supports this with the `build-type`
    `Make` and a trivial setup library [Distribution.Make][dist-make],
    which simply parses the command line arguments and invokes `make`.
    Here `Setup.hs` looks like

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    import Distribution.Make
    main = defaultMain
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The root directory of the package should contain a `configure`
    script, and, after that has run, a `Makefile` with a default target
    that builds the package, plus targets `install`, `register`,
    `unregister`, `clean`, `dist` and `docs`. Some options to commands
    are passed through as follows:

      * The `--with-hc-pkg`, `--prefix`, `--bindir`, `--libdir`, `--datadir`,
        `--libexecdir` and `--sysconfdir` options to the `configure` command are
        passed on to the `configure` script. In addition the value of the
        `--with-compiler` option is passed in a `--with-hc` option and all
        options specified with `--configure-option=` are passed on.

      * The `--destdir` option to the `copy` command becomes a setting
        of a `destdir` variable on the invocation of `make copy`. The
        supplied `Makefile` should provide a `copy` target, which will
        probably look like this:

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        copy :
                $(MAKE) install prefix=$(destdir)/$(prefix) \
                                bindir=$(destdir)/$(bindir) \
                                libdir=$(destdir)/$(libdir) \
                                datadir=$(destdir)/$(datadir) \
                                libexecdir=$(destdir)/$(libexecdir) \
                                sysconfdir=$(destdir)/$(sysconfdir) \
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * You can write your own setup script conforming to the interface
    described in the section on [building and installing
    packages](#building-and-installing-a-package), possibly using the
    Cabal library for part of the work.  One option is to copy the
    source of `Distribution.Simple`, and alter it for your needs.
    Good luck.
