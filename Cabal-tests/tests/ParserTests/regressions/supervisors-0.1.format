synopsis:           Monitor groups of threads with non-hierarchical lifetimes.
description:
    The @supervisors@ package provides a useful abstraction for managing the
    groups of Haskell threads, which may not have a strictly hierarchical
    structure to their lifetimes.
    .
    Concretely, the library provides a `Supervisor` construct, which can be
    used to safely spawn threads while guaranteeing that:
    .
    * When the supervisor is killed, all of the threads it supervises will be
    killed.
    * Child threads can terminate in any order, and memory usage will always
    be proportional to the number of *live* supervised threads.
    .
    One way to think of it is that @supervisors@ is to @async@ as
    @resourcet@ is to @bracket@.
    .
    Note that this package is EXPERIMENTAL; it needs more careful testing before
    I can earnestly recommend relying on it.
    .
    See the README and module documentation for more information.
