[rebindable-clash-paths] Packages using RebindableSyntax with OverloadedStrings or OverloadedLists in default-extensions, in conjunction with the autogenerated module Paths_*, are known to cause compile failures with Cabal < 2.2. To use these default-extensions with a Paths_* autogen module, specify at least 'cabal-version: 2.2'.
