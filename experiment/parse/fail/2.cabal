Synopsis: A framework for using STM within distributed systems
Description:
{-
The DSTM package consists of the DSTM library, a name server application, and
three sample distributed programs using the library. DSTM is a framework
enabling the use of the STM interface, known from concurrent programming, to be
used for distributed Haskell applications as well. Provided are a simple Dining
Philosophers, a Chat, and a soft real-time Bomberman game application.

Distributed communication is transparent to the application programmer. The
application designer uses a very simple nameserver mechanism to set up the 
system. The DSTM library includes the management of unavailable process nodes
and provides the application with abstract error information thus facilitating 
the implementation of robust distributed application programs.

For usage please look into the included file: DSTMManual.pdf.
