If you want to hack on Cabal, don't be intimidated!

Read the guide to the source code:
  https://github.com/haskell/cabal/wiki/Source-Guide

There are other resources listed on the dev wiki:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/

In particular, the open tickets and the cabal-devel mailing list
which is a good place to ask questions.


Dependencies policy
-------------------

Cabal's policy is to support being built by versions of GHC that are up
to 3 years old.
