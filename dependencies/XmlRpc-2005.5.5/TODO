Things that could or should be done:

- Support heterogeneous arrays and structs in the high-level
  interface.

- Support nil

- Use withSocketsDo for Windows compatibility.

- Support variable number of arguments.

- Support method overloading.

- Write a stand-alone server.

Known bugs:

- Years should be 0-padded, but System.Time.formatCalendarTime has
  no option for it.

- Network.XmlRpc.readDateTime requires the year to be exactly four digits,
  what about years < 1000 or > 9999?.

- Non-ascii characters and spaces are not preserved properly in string values.
