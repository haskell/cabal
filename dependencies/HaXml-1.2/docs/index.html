<p>
<b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for parsing, filtering,
transforming, and generating
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a> documents using
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.  Its basic facilities
include:
<ul>
<li> a parser for XML,
<li> a separate error-correcting parser for HTML,
<li> an XML validator,
<li> pretty-printers for XML and HTML.
</ul>

<p>
For processing XML documents, the following components are provided:
<ul>
<li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator library for generic XML document
    processing, including transformation, editing, and generation.
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's Show/Read
    classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary Haskell data as XML
    documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool (available from
    <a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
    <tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
    can automatically derive this class for you.
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD
    into equivalent Haskell types.
<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
    this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as normal
    typed values in programs, and to read and write them as human-readable
    XML documents.
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em> is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents,
    loosely based on the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used
    either from the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
    library.
</ul>

<p>
<a href="HaXml/index.html">Detailed documentation of the HaXml APIs</a>
is generated automatically by Haddock directly from the source code.

<p>
An introduction to HaXml for people who know more about XML than
about Haskell can be found at
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters14.html">
IBM DeveloperWorks</a>.

<p>
A paper describing and comparing the generic Combinators with
the typed representation (DtdToHaskell/Xml2Haskell) is available here:
(12 pages of double-column A4)
<ul>
<li> <a href="icfp99.dvi">icfp99.dvi</a>     (LaTeX dvi format)
<li> <a href="icfp99.ps.gz">icfp99.ps.gz</a> (PostScript format - gzipped)
<li> <a href="icfp99.html">icfp99.html</a>   (HTML format)
</ul>

<p>
Some additional info about using the various facilities is here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="Combinators.html">Combinators</a>       (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Haskell2Xml.html">Haskell2Xml class</a> (HTML format)

<li> <a href="Xtract.html">Xtract tool</a>            (HTML format)
</ul>

<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li> To use <em>-package HaXml</em> interactively with GHCi, you need
     at least ghci-5.02.3.
<li> Haskell2Xml generates Parameter Entity Declarations in the internal
     subset of the DTD, which don't conform to the strict well-formedness
     conditions of XML.  We think the constraint in question is spurious,
     and any reasonable XML tool ought to deal adequately with full PEs.
     Nevertheless, many standard XML processors reject these auto-generated
     DTDs.  The solution is easy - just move the DTD into a separate file!
<li> DtdToHaskell generates the Haskell String type for DTD attributes
     that are of Tokenized or Notation Types in XML.  This may not be
     entirely accurate.
</ul>

instructions for getting ghc by CVS:
<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html">
http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html</a>

<center><h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3></center>
<p>
To install HaXml, you must have a Haskell compiler: <em>ghc-5.02</em>
or later, and/or <em>nhc98-1.14/hmake-3.06</em> or later, and/or
<em>Hugs98 (Sept 2003)</em> or later.  Use

<pre>
    ./configure [--prefix=...] [--buildwith=...]
    make
    make install
</pre>
to configure, build, and install HaXml as a package for your
compiler(s).  You need write permission on the library installation
directories of your compiler(s).  Afterwards, to gain access to
the HaXml libraries, you only need to add the option <tt>-package
HaXml</tt> to your compiler commandline (no option required for Hugs).
Various stand-alone tools are also built - DtdToHaskell, Xtract,
Validate, MkOneOf - and copied to the final installation location
specified by the <tt>--prefix=...</tt> option to <tt>configure</tt>.

<p>
To build/install on a Windows system without the Cygwin shell and
utilities, you can avoid the configure/make steps by simply using the
minimal <em>Build.bat</em> script.  Edit it first for the location
of your compiler etc.

<p>
The latest version (1.12) has the following features and fixes:<br>
<ul>
<li> The licence has changed.  Previously covered by the Artistic Licence,
     we have now converted to the LGPL for all the library code, and GPL
     for the standalone tools.
<li> Now includes a minimal Build.bat script for Windows, so you can
     avoid any need for Cygwin utilities and get by with just GHC
     and Mingw.
<li> Fix a bug in DtdToHaskell, whereby an auxiliary datatype introduced
     by the translation into Haskell could (in certain circumstances)
     cause an extra layer of element tag nesting on the output (via the
     'toElem' method).
<li> Fixed the parsing of entity/character references in the error-correcting
     HTML parser.
<li> Changes in the signatures of Xml2Haskell (made in version 1.09)
     have now been mirrored in the converse library, Haskell2Xml.
     Thus, there are new functions <tt>readXml</tt> and
     <tt>showXml</tt> converting to/from Strings, <tt>hGetXml</tt>
     and <tt>hPutXml</tt> use file Handles, and the old functions using
     filenames are renamed to <tt>fReadXml</tt> and <tt>fWriteXml</tt>.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Joe English has written a more space-efficient parser for XML
    in Haskell, called hxml.  What is more, it can be used as a simple
    drop-in replacement for the HaXml parser!
    <a href="http://www.flightlab.com/~joe/hxml/">Available here</a>.
<li>Uwe Schmidt recently designed another
    <a href="http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/">Haskell XML Toolbox</a>
    based on the ideas of HaXml and hxml.
<li>Some comparisons between functional language approaches to processing
    XML can be found in
    <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/02/14/functional.html">
    Bijan Parsia's article on xml.com</a>
<li>Christian Lindig has written an XML parser in O'Caml:
    <a href="http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/people/lindig/software/tony.html">
    here</a>.
<li>Andreas Neumann of the University of Trier has written a
    validating XML parser in Standard ML:
    <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~neumann/Fxp">here</a>.
<li>Erik Meijer and Mark Shields have a design for a functional programming
    language that treats XML documents as basic data types:
    <a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mbs/pub/xmlambda">XMLambda</a>.
<li>Benjamin Pierce and Haruo Hosoya have a different but similar design in
    <a href="http://xduce.sourceforge.net/">XDuce</a>, which is
    also implemented.
<li>Taking XDuce's approach further, is the very cool
    <a href="http://www.cduce.org/">CDuce</a> by Véronique Benzaken,
    Guiseppe Castagna, and Alain Frisch.  The CDuce language does
    fully statically-typed transformation of XML documents, thus
    guaranteeing correctness, and what is more, it is also faster
    than the untyped XSLT!
<li>The <a href="http://www.xcerpt.org/">Xcerpt project</a> uses HaXml
    to create another rule-based query and transformation language for XML,
    inspired by logic programming, and based on positional selection rather
    than navigational selection.
<li>Ulf Wiger describes an Erlang toolkit for XML:
    <a href="http://www.erlang.se/euc/00/">XMerL</a>
<li>The Java world has adopted the ideas from <em>DtdToHaskell</em> into
    the Java Architecture for XML Binding
    (<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/">JAXB</a>).  JAXB translates
    an XML Schema Definition into a set of Java classes, and provides
    the runtime machinery (like <em>Xml2Haskell</em>) for reading and
    writing objects of those classes to/from XML files.
<li>There is a comprehensive reading list for XML and web programming in
    functional languages <a href="http://readscheme.org/xml-web/">here</a>.
