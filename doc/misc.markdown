# Stability of Cabal interfaces #

The Cabal library and related infrastructure is still under active
development. New features are being added and limitations and bugs are
being fixed. This requires internal changes and often user visible
changes as well. We therefor cannot promise complete future-proof
stability, at least not without halting all development work.

This section documents the aspects of the Cabal interface that we can
promise to keep stable and which bits are subject to change.

## Cabal file format ##

This is backwards compatible and mostly forwards compatible. New fields
can be added without breaking older versions of Cabal. Fields can be
deprecated without breaking older packages.

## Command-line interface ##

### Very Stable Command-line interfaces ###

* `./setup configure`
  * `--prefix`
  * `--user`
  * `--ghc`, `--hugs`
  * `--verbose`
  * `--prefix`

* `./setup build`
* `./setup install`
* `./setup register`
* `./setup copy`

### Stable Command-line interfaces ###

### Unstable command-line ###

## Functions and Types ##

The Cabal library follows the [Package Versioning Policy][PVP]. This
means that within a stable major release, for example 1.2.x, there will
be no incompatible API changes. But minor versions increments, for
example 1.2.3, indicate compatible API additions.

The Package Versioning Policy does not require any API guarantees
between major releases, for example between 1.2.x and 1.4.x. In practise
of course not everything changes between major releases. Some parts of
the API are more prone to change than others. The rest of this section
gives some informal advice on what level of API stability you can expect
between major releases.

### Very Stable API ###

* `defaultMain`

* `defaultMainWithHooks defaultUserHooks`

  But regular `defaultMainWithHooks` isn't stable since `UserHooks`
  changes.

### Semi-stable API ###

* `UserHooks` The hooks API will change in the future

* `Distribution.*` is mostly declarative information about packages and
   is somewhat stable.

### Unstable API ###

Everything under `Distribution.Simple.*` has no stability guarantee.

## Hackage ##

The index format is a partly stable interface. It consists of a tar.gz
file that contains directories with `.cabal` files in. In future it may
contain more kinds of files so do not assume every file is a `.cabal`
file. Incompatible revisions to the format would involve bumping the
name of the index file, i.e., `00-index.tar.gz`, `01-index.tar.gz` etc.
