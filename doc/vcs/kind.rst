  VCS kind

Cabal supports specifying different information for various common source
control systems. This is the name of the source control system used for a
repository. The currently recognised types are:

-  ``darcs``
-  ``git``
-  ``svn``
-  ``cvs``
-  ``mercurial`` (or alias ``hg``)
-  ``bazaar`` (or alias ``bzr``)
-  ``arch``
-  ``monotone``
-  ``pijul``

The VCS kind will determine what other fields are appropriate to specify for a
particular version control system.
