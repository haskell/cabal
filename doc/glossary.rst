   Cabal
      The Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries. Also a
      library of the same name.

   cabal
     The command line tool, ``cabal-install:exe:cabal``, the executable named
     ``cabal`` from the ``cabal-install`` package.

   cabal-install:exe:cabal
     A more explicit way to refer to the ``cabal`` command line tool.

   cabal-install
     The package that provides the ``cabal`` command line tool. Also,
     confusingly, people will say ``cabal-install`` when they want to
     disambiguate between ``cabal`` the tool and ``Cabal`` the library.
