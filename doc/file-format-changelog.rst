==================================================
 Package Description Format Specification History
==================================================

:ref:`pkg-desc` need to specify the version of the
specification they need to be interpreted in via the
:pkg-field:`cabal-version` declaration. The following list describes
changes that occurred in each version of the cabal specification
relative to the respective preceding *published* version.

.. note::

    The sequence of specification version numbers is *not*
    contiguous because it's synchronised with the version of the
    ``Cabal`` library. As a consequence, only *even* versions are
    considered proper published versions of the specification as *odd*
    versions of the ``Cabal`` library denote unreleased development
    branches which have no stability guarantee.

``cabal-version: 3.8``
----------------------

* Added field ``code-generators`` to :pkg-section:`test-suite` stanzas. This
  enumerates executabes (possibly brought into scope by  :pkg-field:`build-tool-depends`) that are run after all other
  preprocessors. These executables are invoked with a target dir for
  output, a sequence of all source directories with source files of
  local lib components that the given test stanza depends on, and
  following a double dash, all options cabal would pass to ghc for a
  build. They are expected to output a newline-separated list of
  generated modules which have been written to the targetdir. This can
  be used for driving doctests and other discover-style tests generated
  from source code.

* Added fields :pkg-field:`extra-libraries-static` and
  :pkg-field:`extra-lib-dirs-static` to allow Haskell libraries to remember
  linker flags needed for fully static linking of system libraries into
  executables.
  The existing field :pkg-field:`pkgconfig-depends` can used to append
  the relevant output of ``pkg-config --libs --static`` to these new fields
  automatically.
  When :pkg-field:`extra-libraries-static` is not given, it defaults to
  :pkg-field:`extra-libraries`.
  When :pkg-field:`extra-lib-dirs-static` is not given, it defaults to
  :pkg-field:`extra-lib-dirs`.

* Wildcard matching has been slightly expanded. Matches are now
  allowed of the form ``foo/**/literalFile``. Prior, double-star
  wildcards required the trailing filename itself be a wildcard.

* Allow the omission of the `type` field in `test-suite` and `benchmark` stanzas
  when the type can be inferred by the presence of `main-is` or `test-module`.

* License fields use identifiers from SPDX License List version
  ``3.16 2022-02-06``

``cabal-version: 3.6``
----------------------

* License fields use identifiers from SPDX License List version
  ``3.10 2020-08-03``

* Add :pkg-field:`hsc2hs-options`

``cabal-version: 3.4``
----------------------


* License fields use identifiers from SPDX License List version
  ``3.9 2020-05-15``

* Dependencies to sublibraries have to be specified explicitly,
  even for current package.
  This way you can have an internal library with the same
  name as some external dependency.

* Remove ``-any`` and ``-none`` syntax for version ranges
  Use ``>=0`` and ``<0`` respectively.

* :pkg-field:`default-language` is optional.
  The Default value is to use the compiler's default language.

* :pkg-field:`mixins` field allow specifying a sublibrary.

``cabal-version: 3.0``
----------------------

* Added the :pkg-field:`extra-dynamic-library-flavours` field to specify non-trivial
  variants of dynamic flavours. It is :pkg-field:`extra-library-flavours` but for
  shared libraries. Mainly useful for GHC's RTS library.

* Free text fields (e.g. :pkg-field:`description`) preserve empty lines
  and indentation. In other words, you don't need to add dots for blank lines.

* License fields use identifiers from SPDX License List version
  ``3.6 2019-07-10``

* Remove deprecated ``hs-source-dir``, :pkg-field:`extensions` and
  :pkg-field:`build-tools` fields.

* Common stanzas are now allowed also in the beginning of conditional
  sections.  In other words, the following is valid

    ::

        library
            import deps

            if flag(foo)
                import foo-deps

* Allow redundant leading or trailing commas in package fields with
  optional commas, such as :pkg-field:`library:exposed-modules`

* Require fields with optional commas to consistently omit or place
  commas between elements.

* Changed the behavior of :pkg-field:`extra-bundled-libraries` field. The naming convention
  of dynamic library files (e.g. generated by a custom build script) has
  changed. For library names prefixed with "C", the dynamic library file
  name(s) must be of the form `lib<library-name>.<dyn-library-extension>*`
  instead of the old `libC<library-name>-ghc<ghc-flavour><ghc-version>.<dyn-library-extension>`

* New set-notation syntax for ``==`` and ``^>=`` operators, see
  :pkg-field:`build-depends` field documentation for examples.

* Allow more whitespace in :pkg-field:`mixins` field

* Wildcards are disallowed in :pkg-field:`pkgconfig-depends`,
  Yet the pkgconfig format is relaxed to accept e.g. versions like ``1.1.0h``.

* New :pkg-field:`autogen-includes` for specifying :pkg-field:`install-includes`
  which are autogenerated (e.g. by a ``configure`` script).

* New :pkg-field:`asm-sources` and :pkg-field:`asm-options` fields
  added for supporting bundled foreign routines implemented in
  assembler.

* New :pkg-field:`cmm-sources` and :pkg-field:`cmm-options` fields
  added for supporting bundled foreign primops implemented in
  C--.

``cabal-version: 2.4``
----------------------

* Wildcard matching has been expanded. All previous wildcard
  expressions are still valid; some will match strictly more files
  than before. Specifically:

  * Double-star (``**``) wildcards are now accepted for recursive
    matching immediately before the final slash; they must be followed
    by a filename wildcard (e.g., ``foo/**/*.html`` is valid;
    ``foo/**/bar/*.html`` and ``foo/**/**/*.html``,
    ``foo/**/bar.html`` are all invalid). As ``**`` was an error in
    globs before, this does not affect any existing ``.cabal`` files
    that previously worked.

  * Wildcards now match when the pattern's extensions form a suffix of
    the candidate file's extension, rather than requiring strict
    equality (e.g., previously ``*.html`` did not match
    ``foo.en.html``, but now it does).

* License fields use identifiers from SPDX License List version
  ``3.2 2018-07-10``


``cabal-version: 2.2``
----------------------

* New :pkg-section:`common` stanzas and :pkg-field:`import`
  pseudo-field added.

* New :pkg-field:`library:virtual-modules` field added.

* New :pkg-field:`cxx-sources` and :pkg-field:`cxx-options` fields
  added for supporting bundled foreign routines implemented in C++.

* New :pkg-field:`extra-bundled-libraries` field for specifying
  additional custom library objects to be installed.

* Extended ``if`` control structure with support for ``elif`` keyword.

* Changed default rules of :pkg-field:`build-type` field to infer
  "build-type:" for "Simple"/"Custom" automatically.

* :pkg-field:`license` field syntax changed to require SPDX
  expression syntax (using SPDX license list version ``3.0 2017-12-28``).

* Allow redundant leading or trailing commas in package fields (which
  require commas) such as :pkg-field:`build-depends`.


``cabal-version: 2.0``
----------------------

* New :pkg-field:`library:signatures` and :pkg-field:`mixins` fields
  added for supporting :ref:`Backpack`.

* New :pkg-field:`build-tool-depends` field added for adding
  build-time dependencies of executable components.

* New :pkg-field:`custom-setup:autogen-modules` field added for declaring modules
  which are generated at build time.

* Support for new PVP_ caret-style version operator (``^>=``) added to
  :pkg-field:`build-depends`.

* Add support for new :pkg-section:`foreign-library` stanza.

* Add support for :ref:`internal library stanzas <sublibs>`.

* New CPP Macro ``CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION``.

``cabal-version: 1.24``
-----------------------

* New :pkg-section:`custom-setup` stanza and
  :pkg-field:`custom-setup:setup-depends` field added for specifying dependencies
  of custom ``Setup.hs`` scripts.

* CPP Macros ``VERSION_$pkgname`` and ``MIN_VERSION_$pkgname`` are now
  also generated for the current package.

* New CPP Macros ``CURRENT_COMPONENT_ID`` and ``CURRENT_PACKAGE_KEY``.

* New :pkg-field:`extra-framework-dirs` field added for specifying
  extra locations to find OS X frameworks.

``cabal-version: 1.22``
-----------------------

* New :pkg-field:`library:reexported-modules` field.

* Support for ``-none`` version constraint added to
  :pkg-field:`build-depends`.

* New :pkg-field:`license` type ``ISC`` added.

``cabal-version: 1.20``
-----------------------

* Add support for new :pkg-field:`license-files` field for declaring
  multiple license documents.

* New CPP Macro ``MIN_TOOL_VERSION_$buildtool``.

* New :pkg-field:`license` types ``BSD2`` and ``MPL-2.0`` added.

``cabal-version: 1.18``
-----------------------

* Add support for new :pkg-field:`extra-doc-files` field for
  specifying extra file assets referenced by the Haddock
  documentation.

* New :pkg-field:`license` type ``AGPL`` and ``AGPL-3`` added.

* Add support for specifying a C/C++/obj-C source file in
  :pkg-field:`executable:main-is` field.

* Add ``getSysconfDir`` operation to ``Paths_`` API.

``cabal-version: 1.16``
-----------------------

.. todo::

   this needs to be researched; there were only few changes between
   1.12 and 1.18;

``cabal-version: 1.12``
-----------------------

* Change syntax of :pkg-field:`cabal-version` to support the new recommended
  ``cabal-version: x.y`` style
