Welcome
=======

Welcome to the Cabal user guide.
Cabal is the "common architecture for building applications and tools" and consists of a fileformat for describing Haskell packages, a library for working with those files, and a commandline tool for downloading, building and running Haskell applications and libraries.

Finding Help
------------

If you are new to Haskell and Cabal, then you can find help in the `Haskell Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#haskell:matrix.org>`__ chat or on the official `Haskell Discourse <https://discourse.haskell.org>`__ forum.

If you want to contact the maintainers and developers of cabal, then you can join the `Cabal and Hackage Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#hackage:matrix.org>`__ chat.
