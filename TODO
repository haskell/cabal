preConf does not have a program configuration available so we cannot run
programs! But that's often exactly what we need to do to help generate the
config. We need a Config monad.

OLD TODOS:

* Parsing
** Make the parsing functions pure.
** Enable access to the x- extension fields, as simple [(String, String)]
    name-value pairs.

* Doc
** elimintate need for cpphs in haddock makefile rule.
** add info about deb packages to web page at least check out the
   manpage for dh_haskell, section "How to package a haskell library"

* Misc
** SDist for windows machines, or machines without tar.
** add sanity checking / QA command?

* testing
** find a real test case that uses preprocessors: gtk2hs
** add a make target or command for tests we know will fail?
** setup test suite to run on --push?
** redirect non-hunit outputs to a file?
** test / port code for Hugs
** error cases for parsing command-line args
** reading & writing configuration-dropping
** use-cases based on SimonPJ's doc

------------------------------------------------------------
-= Future Releases =-

* NHC Support
** look carefully at "rawSystem" and error handing stuff for nhc.
** add install target for nhc
** add information for compiling w/ nhc
** nhc-pkg (see old package manager code)
** register

* Misc
** Reorganize compiler dependent code into Distribution.Compiler.*
** API Versioning? Libtool-style or just a major number?

** sanity checking tool for configuration; are all the .hs files
   included, etc.

** create a (native?) zlib library?

** sign flag?

** for fields like data-files or extra-source-files, allow user to specify
   "foo/bar/*.baz" or something to indicate all files matching that?

** Get function from hmake that creates a directory based on arch.

** ./Setup test
- this may be something that's easy to break off and give to someone
   else.
- give to John Goerzen?

** configure should check for 'ar' args + properties (see fptools/aclocal.m4)

** hat support
** per-system source database
** rebuild for new compiler
** helium
** hbc
