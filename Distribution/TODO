* Documentation
** Integrate SimonPJ's document into the "proposal"

* Code
** Version (simonMar)
** command-line parser (isaac)

* Testing
** Parsing of command-lint opts
** use-cases based on SimonPJ's doc

* Isaac
- test cases for option parsing
-- difference bt flags and opts...

* Priorities for first beta release
(basically what was in SPJ's document):

** Basic command-line interface for configure, build, install,
   register, info
** Ability to wrap make
** basic build system (think hmake)
** binary distributions?

* Priorities for 1.0
** binary distributions?
** basic pre-processor extensions

* looking ahead
** per-system source database
** rebuild for new compiler

* Orthogonal (layered?) tools

** visual studio support

** public database of packages

** downloadable public database of packages (wget filename;tar xf
   filename;cd filename;./setup install)

   NOTE: such an interface might be implemented w/ xml-rpc, which is
   there for Haskell now, though in general we'll probabliy want to be
   careful here about dependencies.

** debian package building (boilerplate) tool.  Other debian support
   w/ rebuild-all-packages?
