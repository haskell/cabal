* Code
** Extensions -> flags interface

** parse pkg.desc
** build (for NHC and Hugs)
** install (for GHC and NHC) - look for .o and .hi, register, etc

** for fields like allModules, allow user to specify "Foo.Bar.*" or
   something to indicate all haskell modules under that?

** SDist for windows machines, or machines without tar.
** Better way to find 'tar'; is there a library?
** sign flag?

** grep for "FIX".

** Get function from hmake that creates a directory based on arch.

** register
** generate InstalledPackageInfo
** read & write config-droppings
** configure: check for presence of build dependencies

** ./Setup test
- this may be something that's easy to break off and give to someone else.

* later todo
** writePersistBuildConfig robustify + diagnostics
** elaborate command-line help text
** configure should check for 'ar' args + properties (see fptools/aclocal.m4)
** most commands should accept a -v flag to show command lines?
** configure should check sanity of PackageDescription, eg. library /= "" ?

* Testing
** error cases for parsing command-line args
** reading & writing configuration-dropping

** use-cases based on SimonPJ's doc
** discovering the location of the given flavor of compiler and pkg tool

-- difference bt flags and opts...

------------------------------------------------------------
* Setup Command-line interface
** Actions
- build
- install (+maybe installprefix, maybe system)
- configure (+flags)
- packageinfo
- sdist
- register (maybe system)
- unregister (maybe system)

** flags
--help
--ghc
--nhc
--hugs
--with-compiler=
--prefix=
--instprefix=

* 1.0
** actions
- bdist
- clean
- doc stuff?

** flags
--hbc
--helium
--with-compiler=



------------------------------------------------------------

* Priorities for first beta release
(basically what was in SPJ's document):

** Basic command-line interface for configure, build, install,
   register, unregister, info
** Ability to wrap make
** basic build system (think hmake)
** binary distributions?

* Priorities for 1.0
** binary distributions?
** basic pre-processor extensions
** hat support
** haddock support
** user use configuration vs system use configuration

* looking ahead
** per-system source database
** rebuild for new compiler

* Orthogonal (layered?) tools

** visual studio support

** public database of packages

** downloadable public database of packages (wget filename;tar xf
   filename;cd filename;./setup install)

   NOTE: such an interface might be implemented w/ xml-rpc, which is
   there for Haskell now, though in general we'll probabliy want to be
   careful here about dependencies.

** debian package building (boilerplate) tool.  Other debian support
   w/ rebuild-all-packages?
