Quirky things about the build system

* The Makefile wraps the standard Cabal setup script; the Makefile is
  a convinience for bootstrapping the system. "sudo make install"
  should handle HUnit, generate the setup script, configure, build,
  install, and register it in a standard location.

* HUnit is included both as a test case for Cabal, and because Cabal
  uses HUnit for testing.  Don't panic.

* HUnit also uses the standard setup script interface, and has to get
  installed and registered before the build setup of Cabal.  The
  install target of the Makefile does everything in the right order.
