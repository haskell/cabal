-= Quirky things about the build system =-

* GNUmakefile is the one you're probably interested in.  If you see
  Makefile, it is probably from the fptools build tree, and it won't
  work on its own.

* The GNUmakefile wraps the standard Cabal setup script; the
  GNUmakefile is a convinience for bootstrapping the system. "sudo
  make install" should handle HUnit, generate the setup script,
  configure, build, install, and register it in a standard location.

* HUnit is included both as a test case for Cabal, and because Cabal
  uses HUnit for testing.  Don't panic.

-= Your Help =-

Portability is one of the most important things about this project.
We don't expect the early releases to work on every system, but it
should work on YOUR system!  If it doesn't please help us figure out
why, and write a patch and test case to fix the problem, if you can!
The codebase is a very manageable size.

-= Code =-

You can get the code from the web page; the version control system we
use is very open and welcoming to new developers.

-= Debian Templates =-

Build a Debian source tree with:

dh_make -d -t /full/path/to/debiantemplates

After, you just need to edit the copyright, description, and
dependencies...
