-= Quirky things about the build system =-

* "make install" as root, then try "ghci -package Cabal" to test it.
  If you get an error about multiple versions of Cabal, read the section
  below "Working with older versions of Cabal"

* GNUmakefile is the one you're probably interested in.  If you see
  Makefile, it is probably from the fptools build tree, and it won't
  work on its own.

* The GNUmakefile wraps the standard Cabal setup script; the
  GNUmakefile is a convinience for bootstrapping the system. "sudo
  make install" should handle HUnit, generate the setup script,
  configure, build, install, and register it in a standard location.

* HUnit is included both as a test case for Cabal, and because Cabal
  uses HUnit for testing.  Don't panic.

-= Working with older versions of Cabal =-

If you have an older version of Cabal installed, you may have to
specify which version you want when you run ghci.  For instance:

  $ ghci -package Cabal
    ...
    ghc-6.4: Error; multiple packages match Cabal: Cabal-1.0, Cabal-1.0.1
  $ ghci -package Cabal-1.0.1
    ...
    (OK)

If you want to avoid this situation, you can remove the older version
with:

  $ ghc-pkg unregister Cabal-1.0

or

  $ ghc-pkg unregister Cabal-1.0 --user

If you don't have root access, and you need to install a newer version
of Cabal in your user directory, then this formula may help to hide
the global version:

  $ ghc-pkg describe Cabal-1.0 | ghc-pkg --user regiser -
  $ ghc-pkg --user hide Cabal-1.0

-= Your Help =-

Portability is one of the most important things about this project.
We don't expect the early releases to work on every system, but it
should work on YOUR system!  If it doesn't please help us figure out
why, and write a patch and test case to fix the problem, if you can!
The codebase is a very manageable size.

-= Code =-

You can get the code from the web page; the version control system we
use is very open and welcoming to new developers.

-= Debian Templates =-

Build a Debian source tree with:

dh_make -d -t /full/path/to/debiantemplates

After, you just need to edit the copyright, description, and
dependencies...
