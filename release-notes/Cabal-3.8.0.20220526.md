Cabal 3.8.0.20220526 Changelog
---

### Significant changes

- Cabal init rewrite [#1074](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1074) [#6758](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6758) [#6864](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6864) [#7251](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7251) [#7255](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7255) [#7256](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7256) [#7273](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7273)

  - Restructures the `cabal init` command to fix historical
    issues. All flags are preserved.
    - Codebases for interactive and non-interactive flags
      are disentangled.
    - Data structures now exploit relevant stanza structure
      and formatters only care about stanza data
    - Heuristics and prompts have a pure and impure implementation.

  - Sets default behavior to be `--interactive` as opposed to
    `--non-interactive`.

  - Rewrites tests to achieve 98% coverage
    - Golden files now test every stanza individually
    - Every flag is covered by a unit test
    - Interactive, simple, and non-interactive workflows are
      covered.

- Make Paths_ modules work with non-standard preludes again [#7494](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7494) [#7649](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7649)

  - Reverts #7510 that failed on Windows when used with pre-generated scripts included in packages such as network, time, process.
  - Adds a subtler fix/workaround for the deficiencies of new autoconf versions on Windows.

- Windows: rewrite paths to configure [#7494](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7494) [#7649](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7649)

- Expose `cabal-install` as library [#1597](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1597) [#3781](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/3781) [#4798](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4798) [#6090](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6090) [#7224](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7224) [#7358](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7358)
- Allow preprocessors to register a reordering [#55](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/55) [#1906](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1906)

  - Changes the PreProcessor type to include a field ppOrdering so that modules are presented to the preprocessor in the right order (w.r.t. dependencies)

- Use ghc -flink-rts option when available [#7763](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7763) [#7764](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7764) [#8111](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8111)

  Previously Cabal did quite some headstands to link against libHSrts.
  Note only this is complex but it couples very tightly to GHC's implementation.
  Thankfully, as of GHC 9.0 GHC provides a -flink-rts flag for precisely this purpose.
  Use it when available.

  It fixed a bug which make Cabal unusable to build foreign libraries for windows and ghc 9.0 or 9.2.
  See <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20520>

- Remove the Generic instance of LicenseId [#8074](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8074) [#8117](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8117)

  - The `Generic` instance of LicenseId is removed, due to the extraordinary amount of memory required to compile
    the Generic instances of large sum types in GHC.

### Other changes

- Handle option argument parse errors without 'error' [#7573](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7573) [#7579](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7579)

  - Errors parsing arguments such as `-v=3` no longer result in
    stack traces.
  - `Distribution.ReadE.readEOrFail` was removed.

- Fix bugs in filename validation [#7426](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7426) [#7429](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7429) [#7479](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7479)

  - Relative paths starting with single-character directories are now properly allowed
  - `cabal check` rejects paths which are invalid on Windows or in tarballs

- Fix test --enable-coverage for multi-package projects [#5213](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5213) [#5433](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5433) [#7200](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7200) [#7250](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7250) [#7467](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7467)

  - Fix `cabal test --enable-coverage` for multi-package projects by invoking `hpc markup --include=` and listing only modules of libraries of the single tested package.

- Make cabal respect setgid permission bit when creating directories [#7560](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7560) [#7572](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7572)

  - Previously cabal would override an admin's choice to use setgid on the
    .cabal directory by using hardcoded file and directory modes upon
    creation. Instead we now take what the system decides and only add to
    that set of permissions.

- Handle conditionals in duplicate module checks [#4629](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4629) [#7525](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7525) [#7616](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7616)

  Improves `cabal check` logic for duplicate modules to take into account conditional branches. If a module appears on both sides of an `if/else` clause in a cabal file, it is now correctly not reported as a duplicate.

- Backtrack when no pkg-config is present [#7448](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7448) [#7621](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7621)

  When solving for pkgconfig-depends, when pkg-config is not present, the cabal solver will now backtrack and try a different automatic flag and dependency configuration, just as it does if pkg-config is present, but does not contain the specified package.

- Add code-generators field to test-suite stanza [#4500](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4500) [#7688](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7688)

  Test-suite stanzas now may contain a `code-generators:` field that can be used to run executables as preprocessors which take existing locations of library code and cabal-generated ghc build flags, and output new modules for use in the test stanza. This can be used to automatically generate drivers for "discover" style tests, including doctests.

- Terminate subprocesses when killed [#7914](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7914) [#7921](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7921)

  - cabal (and 'cabal run' in particular) no longer leaves children running
    when it is killed (unix)

- Cleanup subprocess helpers, remove obsolete functions [#7995](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7995)

  - Distribution.Compat.Process: Remove createProcess, runInteractiveProcess
    and rawSystem.
  - Distribution.Simple.Utils: Remove printRawCommandAndArgs,
    printRawCommandAndArgsAndEnv and createProcessWithEnv.

- Allow glob-star matches with literal filenames (no extensions) [#5883](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5883) [#8005](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8005)

  - Cabal file glob syntax extended to allow matches of the form dir/**/FileNoExtension

- Flatten duplicate warnings about experimental features [#8023](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8023)

  - Make builds that use experimental Cabal language features less noisy. At -v1
    (normal) we show just first instance of use of experimental cabal language
  features, along with count of further occurences in the same file.

- Fix Cabal not finding public sublibraries of installed packages [#7270](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7270) [#8089](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8089)

  Fix bug in lookup of installed sublibraries with nonexact dependencies (ie. when
  not using --exact-configuration). That is the mode of operation of distribution
  packages, so this should allow distros to package Cabal packages with multiple
  libraries.

- Make type field optional for tests and benchmarks [#7459](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7459) [#8115](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8115)

  Allow the omission of the `type` field in `test-suite` and `benchmark` stanzas
  when the type can be inferred by the presence of `main-is` or `test-module`.

- Improve error message for empty --allow-newer=  [#7740](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7740) [#8140](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8140)

  Instead of internal error, the message now explains that empty argument for

  argument) means.

  The LicenseId and LicenseExceptionId types are updated to reflect the SPDX License List version 3.16 (2022-02-06).

  :pkg-field:`extra-libraries`. When :pkg-field:`extra-lib-dirs-static` is not
  given, it defaults to :pkg-field:`extra-lib-dirs`. [#7536](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/7536)
