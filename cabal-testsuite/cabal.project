-- This intercepting project is here to avoid tests picking up a cabal.project
-- from a parent directory, such as the one in the root of the `haskell/cabal`
-- project itself. Having `optional-packages: .` avoids the folowing warning
-- being added to the `.out` file:
--   Warning: There are no packages or optional-packages in the project
optional-packages: .
