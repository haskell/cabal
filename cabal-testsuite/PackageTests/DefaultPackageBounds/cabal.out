Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: foo-0.1.0.0 (user goal)
[__1] rejecting: foo:-build-depends-conflict (constraint from config file, command line flag, or user target requires opposite flag selection)
[__1] trying: foo:+build-depends-conflict
[__2] next goal: time (dependency of foo +/-build-depends-conflict)
[__2] rejecting: time-<VERSION>/installed-<HASH> (conflict: foo +build-depends-conflict => time<0.1)
[__2] fail (backjumping, conflict set: foo, time, foo:build-depends-conflict)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: foo (4), foo:build-depends-conflict (3), time (2)
