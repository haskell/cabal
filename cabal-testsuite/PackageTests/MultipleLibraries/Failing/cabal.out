Resolving dependencies...
Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: d-0.1.0.0 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: p (user goal)
[__1] rejecting: p-0.1.0.0 (requires library 'privatelib' from d, but the component is private)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: d, p)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: d (2), p (2)
