cabal: Couldn't find a freeze file expected at: <ROOT>/cabal.project.missing.freeze.freeze

We are looking for this file because you supplied '--project-file' or '--v2-freeze-file'. When one of these flags is given, we try to read the dependencies from a freeze file. If it is undesired behaviour, you should not use these flags, otherwise please generate a freeze file via 'cabal freeze'.
