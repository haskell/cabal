Resolving dependencies...
Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: q-1.0 (user goal)
[__1] unknown package: p (dependency of q)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: p, q)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: q (2), p (1)
