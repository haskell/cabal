Resolving dependencies...
Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: q-1.0 (user goal)
[__1] unknown package: base (dependency of q)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: base, q)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: q (2), base (1)
