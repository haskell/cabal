cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] next goal: pkg (user goal)
[__0] rejecting: pkg-2.0 (constraint from user target requires ==1.0)
[__0] rejecting: pkg-1.0 (constraint from command line flag requires ==2.0)
[__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: pkg)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: pkg (3)
