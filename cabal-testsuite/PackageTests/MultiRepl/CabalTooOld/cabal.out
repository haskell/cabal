Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: pkg-a-0 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: pkg-a:setup.Cabal (dependency of pkg-a)
[__1] rejecting: pkg-a:setup.Cabal-<VERSION>/installed-<HASH>, pkg-a:setup.Cabal-3.8.0.0 (constraint from --enable-multi-repl requires >=3.11)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: pkg-a, pkg-a:setup.Cabal)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: pkg-a:setup.Cabal (3), pkg-a (2)
