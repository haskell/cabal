Resolving dependencies...
Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] next goal: my-lib (user goal)
[__0] rejecting: my-lib; 2.0, 1.0
      (constraint from cabal.project requires ==0.9)
[__0] trying: my-lib-0.9
[__1] next goal: plain (user goal)
[__1] rejecting: plain-0.1.0.0 (conflict: my-lib==0.9, plain => my-lib>1)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: my-lib, plain)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: my-lib (4), plain (2)
