Resolving dependencies...
Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] next goal: CheckExtraProgPathGlobal (user goal)
[__0] rejecting: CheckExtraProgPathGlobal-0.1 (pkg-config package zlib-any is needed but no pkg-config executable was found or querying it failed)
[__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: CheckExtraProgPathGlobal)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: CheckExtraProgPathGlobal (2)
