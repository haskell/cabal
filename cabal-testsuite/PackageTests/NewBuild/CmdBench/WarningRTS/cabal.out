Warning: Some RTS options were found standalone, which affect cabal and not the binary. Please note that +RTS inside the --benchmark-options argument suffices if your goal is to affect the benchmarked binary. For example, use "cabal test --benchmark-options='+RTS -N'" to pass the '-N' RTS option to your binary.
