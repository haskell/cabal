Resolving dependencies...
Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: p-1.0 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: q (user goal)
[__1] rejecting: q-1.0 (requires library from p, but the component is not buildable in the current environment)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: p, q)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: p (2), q (2)
