-- This test is similar to the simplified example in issue #4288. The package's
-- setup script only depends on base and setup-helper. setup-helper exposes a
-- function that is a wrapper for Cabal's defaultMain (similar to
-- cabal-doctest). This test builds the package to check that the flags passed
-- to the setup script are compatible with the version of Cabal that it depends
-- on, even though Cabal is only a transitive dependency.
