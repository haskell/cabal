Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: b-0 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: other-lib (dependency of b)
[__1] fail (not a user-provided goal nor mentioned as a constraint, but reject-unconstrained-dependencies=all was set)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: b, other-lib)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: b (2), other-lib (1)
