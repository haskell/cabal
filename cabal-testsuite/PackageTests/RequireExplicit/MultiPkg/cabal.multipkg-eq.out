Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: a-0 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: some-lib (dependency of a)
[__1] fail (not a user-provided goal nor mentioned as a constraint, but reject-unconstrained-dependencies=eq was set)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: a, some-lib)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: a (2), some-lib (1)
