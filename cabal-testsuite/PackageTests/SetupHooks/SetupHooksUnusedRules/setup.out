Warning: The following rules are not demanded and will not be run:
  - RuleId {ruleNameSpace = RulesNameSpace {rulesUnitId = UnitId "main", rulesModuleName = ModuleName "SetupHooks", rulesSrcLoc = (19,59)}, ruleName = "r1"},
    generating [setup.dist/work/dist/build/autogen </> X.hs,setup.dist/work/dist/build/autogen </> Y.hs]

    generating [setup.dist/work/dist/build/autogen </> Z.hs]
Possible reasons for this error:
  - Some autogenerated modules were not declared
    (in the package description or in the pre-configure hooks)
  - The output location for an autogenerated module is incorrect,
    (e.g. the file extension is incorrect, or
     it is not in the appropriate 'autogenComponentModules' directory)
