# cabal check
The following errors will cause portability problems on other environments:
Error: [no-autogen-paths] Packages using 'cabal-version: 2.0' and the autogenerated module Paths_* must include it also on the 'autogen-modules' field besides 'exposed-modules' and 'other-modules'. This specifies that the module does not come with the package and is generated on setup. Modules built with a custom Setup.hs script also go here to ensure that commands like sdist don't fail.
Error: [no-autogen-pinfo] Packages using 'cabal-version: 2.0' and the autogenerated module PackageInfo_* must include it in 'autogen-modules' as well as 'exposed-modules' and 'other-modules'. This specifies that the module does not come with the package and is generated on setup. Modules built with a custom Setup.hs script also go here to ensure that commands like sdist don't fail.
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
