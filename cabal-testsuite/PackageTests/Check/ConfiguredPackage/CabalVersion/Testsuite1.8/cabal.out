# cabal check
Warning: The following errors will cause portability problems on other environments:
Warning: The 'test-suite' section is new in Cabal 1.10. Unfortunately it messes up the parser in older Cabal versions so you must specify at least 'cabal-version: >= 1.8', but note that only Cabal 1.10 and later can actually run such test suites.
Warning: Hackage would reject this package.
