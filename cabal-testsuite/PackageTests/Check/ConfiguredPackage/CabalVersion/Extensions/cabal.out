# cabal check
The following errors are likely to affect your build negatively:
Error: [extensions-field] For packages using 'cabal-version: >= 1.10' the 'extensions' field is deprecated. The new 'default-extensions' field lists extensions that are used in all modules in the component, while the 'other-extensions' field lists extensions that are used in some modules, e.g. via the {-# LANGUAGE #-} pragma.
These warnings will likely cause trouble when distributing the package:
Warning: [parser-warning] pkg.cabal:14:3: The field "extensions" is deprecated in the Cabal specification version 1.12. Please use 'default-extensions' or 'other-extensions' fields.
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
