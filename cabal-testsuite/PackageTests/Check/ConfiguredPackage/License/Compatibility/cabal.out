# cabal check
The following errors will cause portability problems on other environments:
Error: [license-parse] Unfortunately the license 'ISC' messes up the parser in earlier Cabal versions so you need to specify 'cabal-version: >= 1.4'. Alternatively if you require compatibility with earlier Cabal versions then use 'OtherLicense'.
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
