# cabal check
The package will not build sanely due to these errors:
Error: [impossible-dep] The package has an impossible version range for a dependency on an internal library: pkg:internal >1.0 && <2.0. This version range does not include the current package, and must be removed as the current package's library will always be used.
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
