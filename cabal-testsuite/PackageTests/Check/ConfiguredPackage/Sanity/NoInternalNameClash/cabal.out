# cabal check
The package will not build sanely due to these errors:
Error: [illegal-library-name] Illegal internal library name pkg. Internal libraries cannot have the same name as the package. Maybe you wanted a non-internal library? If so, rewrite the section stanza from 'library: 'pkg' to 'library'.
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
