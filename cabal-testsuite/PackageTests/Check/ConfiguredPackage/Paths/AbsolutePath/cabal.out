# cabal check
These warnings may cause trouble when distributing the package:
Warning: [glob-missing-dir] In 'extra-source-files': the pattern '/home/user/file' attempts to match files in the directory '/home/user', but there is no directory by that name.
The following errors will cause portability problems on other environments:
Error: [absolute-path] 'extra-source-files: /home/user/file' specifies an absolute path, but the 'extra-source-files' field must use relative paths.
Error: [malformed-relative-path] 'extra-source-files: /home/user/file' is not a good relative path: "posix absolute path"
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
