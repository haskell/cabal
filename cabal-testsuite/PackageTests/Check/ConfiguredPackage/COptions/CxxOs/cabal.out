# cabal check
Warning: These warnings may cause trouble when distributing the package:
Warning: 'cxx-options: -O[n]' is generally not needed. When building with  optimisations Cabal automatically adds '-O2' for C++ code. Setting it yourself interferes with the --disable-optimization flag.
Warning: Please consider including a changelog file in the 'extra-doc-files' section of the .cabal file if it contains useful information for users of the package.
