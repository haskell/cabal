# cabal check
The following errors are likely to affect your build negatively:
Error: 'ghc-shared-options: -hide-package' is never needed. Cabal hides all packages.
The following errors will cause portability problems on other environments:
Error: 'ghc-options: -fasm' is unnecessary and will not work on CPU architectures other than x86, x86-64, ppc or sparc.
Error: 'ghc-prof-options: -fhpc' is not necessary. Use the configure flag  --enable-coverage instead.
Error: 'ghc-shared-options: -Werror' makes the package easy to break with future GHC versions because new GHC versions often add new warnings. Alternatively, if you want to use this, make it conditional based on a Cabal configuration flag (with 'manual: True' and 'default: False') and enable that flag during development.
Error: Hackage would reject this package.
