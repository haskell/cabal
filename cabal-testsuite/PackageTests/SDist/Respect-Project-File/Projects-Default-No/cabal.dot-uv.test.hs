-- sdist" writes sdist/p-0.1.tar.gz instead of the expected sdist/uv-0.1.tar.gz.
-- That is wrong, "cabal sdist" should respect the "--project-file" option but
-- instead probes the parent directory and picks up "../cabal.project" that has
-- "packages: Projects-Default-No/p".
--
-- TODO: Fix this behaviour and apply the patch cabal.dot-uv.patch to update the
-- expected output to what we'd expect if "cabal sdist" respected the project.
