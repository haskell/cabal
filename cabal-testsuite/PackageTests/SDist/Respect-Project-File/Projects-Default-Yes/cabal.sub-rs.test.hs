-- sdist/p-0.1.tar.gz and sdist/q-0.1.tar.gz instead of the expected
-- sdist/r-0.1.tar.gz and sdist/s-0.1.tar.gz. That is wrong, "cabal sdist"
-- should respect the "--project-file" option but instead picks up the default
-- "cabal.project" that has "packages: p/ q/".

-- TODO: Fix this behaviour and apply the patch cabal.sub-rs.patch to update the
-- expected output to what we'd expect if "cabal sdist" respected the project.
