-- The local package, pkg-1.0, depends on build-tool-pkg-1 as a library and
-- build-tool-pkg-2 as a build-tool.  This test checks that cabal uses the
-- correct version of build-tool-pkg for each purpose.  pkg imports a version
-- number from the build-tool-pkg library and uses the build-tool-pkg executable
-- as a preprocessor to insert the executable's version number into the source
-- code.  Then the pkg executable prints out both versions.
--
-- Issue #5409 caused v2-build to use the same instance of build-tool-pkg for
-- the build-depends and build-tool-depends dependencies, even though it
-- violated the version constraints.
