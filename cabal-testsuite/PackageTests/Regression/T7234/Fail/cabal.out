Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] next goal: issue7234 (user goal)
[__0] rejecting: issue7234-0 (conflict: requires unknown extension HopefullyThisExtensionWontOccur)
[__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: issue7234)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: issue7234 (2)
