cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
trying: time-99999 (user goal)
next goal: time:setup.Cabal (dependency of time-99999)
rejecting: time:setup.Cabal-<VERSION>/installed-<HASH>... (conflict: time => time:setup.Cabal==99999)
trying: time:setup.Cabal-99999
next goal: time:setup.time (dependency of time:setup.Cabal-99999)
rejecting: time:setup.time~>time-99999 (cyclic dependencies; conflict set: time:setup.Cabal, time:setup.time)
rejecting: time:setup.time-99999 (multiple instances)
rejecting: time:setup.time-<VERSION>/installed-<HASH>... (constraint from command line flag requires ==99999)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: time (7), time:setup.Cabal (4), time:setup.time (4)
